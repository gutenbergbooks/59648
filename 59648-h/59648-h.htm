<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>NICHOL the Jester having left this world
for, we trust, a better, and thereto we
cry “God rest his soul,” Peregrine his son
reigned in his stead.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was in accordance with custom. Six
times had cap and bells descended from father
to son: we see Peregrine as the seventh inheritor
thereto, which, perchance, holds some significance.
Pythagorus would doubtless have
told us it held much; would have told us we
find in seven the last of the limited numbers,
a mere step from it to the free vibrations.
Also he would have seen double significance
in that Peregrine’s own name held the same
vibration. And who are we to say him nay?</p>

<p class='c011'>For my part I would no more dream of
venturing to gainsay him than I would venture
to gainsay the old sage who read the message
of the stars at his birth. This sage, finding
him born under the third decanate of Sagittarius,
with Uranus in the ascendant, and
having muttered of houses, and cusps, and
aspects, and signs, and I know not what
besides,—and if I did would refrain from
further enumeration lest I should weary you,—proclaimed
him one born to wander, a
seeker after that which is not easily found,—of
the sign of Sagittarius, and the planet Uranus
are antiquarians and alchemists. He gave
him also favours from one of high birth, which
favours should wither like June roses when
picked; gave him sorrow as companion for a
space,—though truly there is no mother’s son
of us knows not that companion for a while,—and
the end of his life’s journey he saw not.
Whereat I, for one, rejoice, since—though I
would not venture to gainsay the old sage—I
believe that the ordering of a man’s destiny
lies not with the stars, but with One Who holds
the universe in the Hollow of His Hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>Lisette, wife of Nichol the Jester, gave however
full credence to the sage, a credence equal
to that she gave to the dogmas of Holy Church,
therein showing herself illogical after the
manner of women, since our Mother the
Church has ever bade us have no dealing
with omens, dreams, the riddle of the stars,
and such-like fooleries. Despite this, and
having given, as we have seen, credulous ear
to the sage’s prophecy, she named the boy
Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>When first breeched he was costumed as a
miniature edition of his sire, half black, half
white, in cognizance of the rôle he would later
play in truth. The cap surrounded a chubby
face, not yet outgrown the solemnity of babyhood.
His hand, fat and dimpled, grasped
the belled bauble. Borne aloft on his father’s
shoulder to the great hall, he was set in the
midst of the squires and dames,—more particularly
the dames, since the squires for the
most part were that day following their lord
over Exmoor in pursuit of the wild red deer.</p>

<p class='c011'>They saw in him a pretty enough plaything;
found, for a time at least, greater novelty in
his solemn silences and rare smiles than in
his father’s jests. The Lady Clare de Belisle
entering with her own child, a girl babe of
two summers, touched the tiny jester’s cheek
with one jewelled finger, commended him for a
bonny boy. The two children gazed at each
other solemn-eyed, till Isabel, the girl, putting
forth her hand was for taking the young
jester’s bauble from him. Thereat Peregrine
clutched it jealously to his breast, having no
mind to part with his toy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I want,” said Isabel, one fat finger pointed
towards the treasure clutched by the scowling
boy. That was the way with Isabel in childhood
as in later years, knowing what she
desired she hesitated not to demand it, and
obtain it by whatever means came best to
hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is not becoming that the son of a Jester
should deny the desire of his Lady’s daughter.
Nichol, the dames, my Lady even, were prepared
for insistence, a ruthless seizing of the
treasure from the baby grasp; when suddenly
and without compulsion, the child’s mien
changed. Of his own accord he tendered the
bauble to Isabel.</p>

<p class='c011'>She took it, smiling. Even babes can be
gracious when their wish is granted. For a
moment she held it examining it with curiosity,
a curiosity soon satiated, since after a brief
space she held it in a listless hand, tendered
it again.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I don’t like it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine backed away from her. Perhaps—in
fact I am sure—there was reproach in
his blue eyes. So for a moment they stood.
Then Isabel cast the bauble upon the ground.
And herein some may read an omen. The
squires and dames laughed; my Lady murmured
a gentle word of chiding; Nichol picked
up the bauble; but Peregrine still looked at
Isabel.</p>

<p class='c011'>This, then, was Peregrine’s introduction to
that society wherein later he was to wear the
cap and bells as no mere pastime but in very
truth. Nor was it at this time his last appearance
therein. For the first few years of his
life he played, in a manner, the rôle of zany
to his father, gaining thereby much favour.
Candour, a virtue allowed both children and
fools, was a marked characteristic of Peregrine’s.
If at moments the recipients of his
frank speeches felt a trifle of embarrassment
there was always the knowledge that their
own blush or wince would presently be superseded
by a laugh at the blush or wince of
another. This squared all accounts, made the
momentary embarrassment worth enduring.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet what may well pass as the artlessness
of a child, the privilege of a fool, is of other
brand from the boy. With the loss of his
milk teeth—and he was full late in parting
with them—Peregrine’s candour began to lose
its charm. Outspoken speeches when issuing
from between cherry lips and pearls are of
different ilk when the pearls are lacking.
Herein we see the injustice of the world.</p>

<p class='c011'>The day came when an outspoken speech of
Peregrine’s, exceeding apt, perchance of over-candour,—though
assuredly a year ago it
would have gained him high applause,—was
taken in ill part. True, there were some who
tittered, yet surreptitiously, feeling the atmosphere
somewhat charged with unfriendly
omen, an omen none could overlook, seeing
that it emanated from the guest of note who
sat frowning at the insouciant Peregrine.
Had the guest been of less importance it is
possible the affair might have been settled
by a slight rebuke, but with her rank and
dignity in view no such flimsy method was of
avail.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine was dismissed the hall wherein
he had been a petted favourite since his first
breeching; and, before being deprived of cap
and bells, was breeched—and soundly—after
other fashion, the distinguished guest having
made it evident that the smart of her wounded
feelings could only be eased by the smarting
of Peregrine’s small body.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sore and sobbing he sought his mother, wept
out his woes, his perplexities, his hot face
buried in her lap. Thus with pain of body,
though with but dim realization of mind,
Peregrine first became acquainted with the
injustice of the world.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a time Peregrine saw the hall no more.
Clad after the ordinary manner of his kind he
kept out of the way of the noblesse, the gentry,
ill at ease when he by chance crossed their
path, found what human companionship he
would among the servitors alone,—excepting
always that of his father and mother, in whose
company he at all times found pleasure.</p>

<p class='c011'>He took now to frequenting the woods and
moors which lay around the castle. Lying
on the heather, its scent and the scent of the
golden gorse warm and fragrant in his nostrils,
he would gaze over the surrounding country,
see the blue channel below him gleaming in
the sunlight, the Welsh coast dim and hazy
beyond, look northwards to the small town
nestling at the foot of the hill which rises some
eight hundred feet above it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Roaming the woods he would watch for
the first hint of Spring in the swelling buds of
the larch trees, would rejoice in the faint
shimmer of green flung over them when she
first shows a shy face, would seek among
brown leaves scattered on the ground for the
pale primrose, the delicate windflower, the
fragile wood sorrel with its tiny white petals
lightly veined in mauve. Here he learned of
the ways of the wild creatures of nature,
rather than the ways of men, and found them
more to his liking. What we give that shall
we receive, so are we told, though verily there
are times when the giving will appear to outweigh
all receipts. Possibly this is because
we look to reward to follow hard upon bestowal,
trust not to the finding after many
days. Here in the woods, however, Peregrine
found swift reward. The love he bestowed
upon the woodland creatures gained
him their love in return. The birds would
feed from his hand, the animals brought their
young to play at his feet; confidence between
them and him reached a very pretty note of
harmony.</p>

<p class='c011'>Wandering further afield he would watch the
red deer which in daylight found hiding-place
in distant combes, see them in moonlight
moving in great herds across the moor. In
the combes he would go boldly up to them,
feed them with pieces of coarse bread, and
bunches of freshly pulled grass. Only in the
mating season he left them alone, knowing
the wild jealousy of the stag.</p>

<p class='c011'>When, as frequently happened, he heard
the huntsman’s horn, caught a glimpse of
hounds, horses, and their riders in full cry, he
would clench his brown fists, his young jaw
set in a grim line, his whole body a-quiver
with rage. Even so might a man feel who
saw his friend hunted to his death.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once when the harriers were out after a
hare, and being close on her heels, the frighted
creature, seeing Peregrine, turned, crouching
at his feet. In a twinkling he had her in his
arms, swarmed, still holding her, up an oak,
whence hidden in the topmost branches, too
slender to bear aught but a boy’s weight, he
heard angry baying at the tree’s base. Presently
up came the huntsmen. There was a
colloquy, a debating. The foliage was too
thick to allow of Peregrine being perceived,
perched as he was aloft, one arm entwining
a bough, the other clutching the hare, which
for the moment lay panting, too frightened for
struggle. It is not in the nature of things
for hares to climb trees; nor was the actual
occurrence one likely to dawn on the unaided
imagination. Baffled, perplexed, the huntsmen
stood among the baying harriers, scratching
their heads, flicking their boots with their
riding crops, swearing meanwhile each after
his own particular form and fancy. And the
dogs, who might have told them the manner
of the happening, being dumb of human
speech but bayed the louder. A hole in the
oak’s trunk some four feet or so from the
ground offered a solution, an unlikely one
enough, yet at this juncture better than none.
Madam Hare, so they asseverated among
themselves, had sprung for the hole and by
ill chance for their sport had reached it. No
doubt she was now crouched within the hollow
of the oak. To get her out was impossible,
short of felling the tree; and in very sooth she
had found a worse death within that prison
than the quick end the dogs would have made
of her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet, in spite of seeing Madam Hare as
escaped from their clutches, a victim of a slow
death by starvation, they still lingered, muttering,
jabbering, swearing; the dogs still making
loud din, causing Peregrine’s heart to beat
with fear, knowing not of the hole in the tree
which had doubtless saved his skin, and the
life of the trembling creature in his arm. The
weight of the animal was no light one, and his
muscles began to suffer cramp. Feeling extremity
at hand he put up a small prayer, which possibly
was heard by Saint Francis, seeing he had
once rescued a like creature from the hounds.
Whether it was the advocacy of the prayer, or
whether the huntsmen were weary of their sojourn
beneath the tree, you may settle as it best
pleases you; for my part I will maintain that
the Saint himself drew them away, caused
them to call off the dogs, and ride baulked of
their prey away from wood and moor.</p>

<p class='c011'>Silence had fallen for the space of some ten
or fifteen minutes before Peregrine thought
safe to descend; and in that the hare had lain
quiet so long we may likewise see the hand of
the gentle Saint. Twenty yards or so away
from the tree, clear from the scent of the dogs,
Peregrine deposited his burden upon the
ground. A moment she crouched while his
hand caressed her soft fur, then leaping,
vanished down the glade.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet this freedom of wood and moorland,
this sojourning with wild creatures, that I have
shown you, belonged in main to Peregrine’s
boyhood. As he grew older it was not
thought well, by those who had a say in the
matter, that he should roam in idleness.
Those who eat bread must needs earn it after
some fashion, save those who are born, as the
saying is, with a silver spoon in the mouth.
Peregrine after a while found his hours
of roaming curtailed. Armourer, falconer,
grooms, alike pressed him into service. No
special calling allotted him in view of the one
rôle he should later play—though if the truth
be known he looked to it with but little
favour—he became the server of many. This,
as may be imagined, irked him somewhat.
He had no mind to await any man’s behest,
yet mind or not he found it must needs be
done. Being no fool he brought, then, to his
tasks what good grace he might. Besides
his work with armourer, falconer, and grooms,
he learned to play the tabor, and had a very
pretty skill thereon.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of these years I have little to record. They
were in the main uneventful. Their chief
incident as far as Peregrine was concerned,
and one of deep sorrow to him, was his
mother’s death. That was a sorrow which
lay heavy for many a long month, till time at
length began imperceptibly to ease the burden
of his grief.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine had come to man’s estate, had
seen, I take it, four and twenty summers or
thereabouts, when Nichol was stricken of the
ague which was to end for him this mortal
life. Lying gaunt and hollow-eyed on his
bed, the cap and bells on an oak chest near, he
called his son to him, pointed with one wasted
hand towards the motley dress.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To-morrow, or the next day, you will be
wearing it,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine bowed his head. Finding it ill
to lie, even for comfort’s sake, in the face of
Death, he was silent.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A jest more often than not holds truth,”
said Nichol, “yet now, between you and me,
the truth may be spoken without need of
jest.” His eyes, blue like Peregrine’s, sought
his son’s eyes, but Peregrine’s were lowered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look at me,” said his father.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine raised his eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You like not the thought. That I have
long known. Yet, what will you? Fate
made of me a Jester, as she made a Jester of
my father and his sires before me, as she now
makes one of you. I accepted my rôle as in
the nature of things. With you it is otherwise.
Submitting outwardly to the decree of fate,
inwardly your spirit rebels. It will be hard
for you. The rôle of Jester is no easy one.
Dogs are we, waiting with a dog’s wistfulness
on the smile of our master’s lips, the pat of
our master’s hand. And if, rather than smile
and pat, we receive frown and blow, yet may
we not bite, since that is of the manner of a
cur; nor cringe, since cringing is likewise of a
cur. We must accept the frown and blow
submissively, should e’en return with wagging
tail to fawn upon the hand that struck us; and
if we are wise dogs will learn new tricks better
suited to please. And the man’s heart in us
we should drug, if we cannot kill it, lest it
grow to torment us. I drugged mine, or
tried to. It was, perchance, too strong to
kill. Yet for all the drugging there were
times when it pulsed less sluggishly. That
day when they took the cap and bells from
you, when they beat you, poor miserable little
fool, I jested my best. Had I not jested I
would have flung my bauble in the face of the
woman who sat there smiling as your cries
reached the hall. And the man’s heart
suffered torment that day in the dog’s body.
Yet Jester I was then, Jester I have been since.
Now at last I am man, and wholly man.
Death, when his shadow touches us, grants
us that much solace.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He stopped. Peregrine, kneeling by the
bed, found no words.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Custom,” went on Nichol, “is strong
upon man; strongest of all, perchance, upon
the Jester. Despite our moments of resentment
we look for applause. It is our life, our
breath. We long for the favour of our master.
I have said we are dogs, and when that is
said, all is said. Yet the man’s heart may
outgrow the dog’s body. You will don the
motley; you, too, will fawn upon the hand
that strikes you; you, too, will watch with
wistful eyes on the desire of your master. Yet
if, as I fancy, the day dawns when drugs no
longer bring their soothing anodyne to your
man’s heart, when the soul within the motley
is a soul in prison, then remember that I now
have asked your pardon for the heritage you
will accept from me. That is all. Now, son,
fetch me a priest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Of Peregrine’s words e’er he went to fulfil
his father’s last behest, I make no record.
They were not intended, as may well be
guessed, for you or me to know. When they
were spoken he rose from his knees, set out
for the Abbey of Our Lady of the Cliff.</p>

  <h2 id='ch02' class='c006'>CHAPTER II<br /> <br />THE FOOL’S ENTRY</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>AND so it came to pass that Peregrine again
saw the hall, entered thereto garbed
once more in cap and bells. Candour, so he
decreed, should be far from his lips, having
in his mind the memory of a day now some
sixteen years old. It was not for these among
whom he should pass his time. Guile, art,
cynicism, anything but truth should be used
wherewith to fashion the jests, the darts of
speech which he should throw abroad. A
Jester heedless of applause, of frowns, or
smiles, thus he saw himself, wise for the
moment in his own conceit.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here you perceive youth, which sees itself
strong to venture, disbelieving the prophecies
of age. Yet were it not for venturesome
youth we may well believe that little
would be attained. The babe, who first
totters on unsteady feet, may well lack the
qualms, the anxieties of the mother who sees
the fall imminent. Had the babe her mental
tremors methinks there is no mother’s son
of us would learn aught but to crawl.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>Peregrine stood by the window in the great
hall. He found himself alone. Rain, a thin
mist of a rain, fell ceaselessly, insidiously
from a leaden sky. The cloyed earth accepted
it patiently. There was no joy in
the acceptance, no eager thirst as for silver
showers streaming downwards. Sodden and
satiated it longed for the benign rays of the
sun to awaken the half-drowned life within its
bosom.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine looking across the park to the
further reaches of the moorland saw it
through a grey mist. The outlook accorded
well with his mood. It lacked colour, buoyancy.
The future appeared as skeleton as
the bare branches of the trees flung against
the sullen sky. If Nature’s spring were at
hand she hid her face well. Mentally he had
no glimpse of her, nor looked to have any. A
morbid mood for a man you may well say,
yet this was Peregrine’s at the moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>Turning from the window he scanned the
hall, his eyes roving from inlaid floor to domed
ceiling, from arched doorway to carved fireplace.
The daylight was waning. Shadows
loomed in the corners, were flung trembling
on the walls by the firelight,—tongued flames
among great logs. The light caught the
blazon of the house of Belisle among the
carving of the overmantel.—<i>On a field argent
an inescutcheon azure set within an orle of roses
gules.</i></p>

<p class='c011'>He looked at it thoughtfully, memory
astir. As a child the vivid bit of colour had
pleased him as it flashed jewel-like in sunshine
or firelight from the sombre shadows of
the oak. It pleased his eye now no less,
though memory pricking touched the old
wound anew.</p>

<p class='c011'>To him in this pensive mood entered a
page, a slim lad in blue and silver. Peregrine
engrossed in thought heard no sound
till:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ahem!” coughed the page.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine started, looked up, met a pair of
grey eyes, mischief lurking in their depths,
saw a smooth-skinned, square-faced lad, wide-mouthed,
with tip-tilted nose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Craving your pardon for breaking in upon
your meditations,” quoth the lad with mock
respect, “but the Lady Isabel desires your
presence.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine, returning to matters of the moment,
experienced a heart beat. Here was his
stage call, and his part by no means well-conned
as yet. Save at a distance he had not
set eyes upon the Lady Isabel since childhood,
sole mistress now of the house of Belisle, since
the Lady Clare, her mother, had been laid to
rest. The Lord Robert de Belisle, her father,
was in Gascony with his King subduing a
rebellion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And she has sent you to demand my
presence?” asked Peregrine lazily, his inward
tremor well controlled.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Since I am here,” grinned the boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where is she?” demanded Peregrine, less
desirous of knowing than wishful to gain a
moment’s respite.</p>

<p class='c011'>“In the west chamber among her women,”
replied the boy. “She is—weary.” A pause
preceded the last word.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine lifted his tabor from the broad
sill of the window.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Take me to her,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>Crossing the hall and mounting the stairs
the boy eyed Peregrine, gave him the close
scrutiny of childhood, summed up what he
found there, and I fancy found it not amiss for
all that it is not usual to pay a vast respect to
fools. Peregrine caught the lad’s eye upon
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, what do you make of me?” he
smiled.</p>

<p class='c011'>The boy flushed scarlet from brow to
chin. Having caught a glimpse of the man
beneath the motley words halted on his
tongue.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your name?” asked Peregrine still smiling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Antony Philip Delamore,” stuttered the
lad. “They call me Pippo.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pippo,” echoed Peregrine thoughtfully.
And the boy heard the name pleasantly from
his lips.</p>

<p class='c011'>The stairs mounted they passed along a
corridor, paused at an alcove curtain-hung
with tapestry. Here Pippo, entering first,
held aside the heavy draperies.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam, the Jester awaits your pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c011'>A voice smooth, flexible, yet holding, one
would say, a ring of metal rather than a hint
of silkiness, replied:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, let him enter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine stepped across the threshold, and
Pippo let the curtain fall behind him.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the room lighted by candles, a woman
sat beside the fireplace. Her dress was of
crimson silk, a splash of colour against the
darkness of the oak chair, and in the shadows
of the room. She was tall and very slight,
yet you could not call her thin. Her skin
was of ivory whiteness. Her brow, low and
broad, was framed in masses of dark hair
glinting with vivid red lights. You caught
the gleam of pearls among its darkness.
Towards the chin the face narrowed sharply.
The mouth, subtle-lipped, showed a hint of
snowy teeth. The eyes brown, lustrous, with
the blue whites of a child’s eyes, looked from
beneath level brows towards the curtain.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine saw her eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>With her were her four women,—Mary
Chester, the oldest, steady-eyed, smooth-haired,
common sense well mingled with
devoutness; Leonora Ashton, a well grown
girl, built to be the mother of sons, healthy
in mind and body alike; Monica Cardew, a
willowy slip of a girl, dreamy, with little
thought beyond her embroideries and her
rosary; and last Brigid Carlisle, square-faced,
merry, something boyish. Well-favoured
women the first three, each after her own
fashion, Brigid alone having no pretension to
looks, though a pleasant face you would have
found it, yet the beauty of the three maids
dimmed beside that of the mistress.</p>

<p class='c011'>Nature as a rule gives discreetly. Giving
features she deems to have done well if
she withholds colouring, giving colouring she
withholds features. Giving brains she often
withholds form, giving form she may pay but
scant attention to brains. Of virtue I make
no mention seeing it is a gift of grace rather
than appertaining solely to Nature. Yet
now and again, at rare moments truly, Nature
becomes prodigal of her gifts, bestows open-handed.
Thus her gifts to Isabel de Belisle.
I have given you but the outline, you may fill
in the detail, and add thereto that most subtle,
elusive, and unaccountable of her gifts,—charm,
personality, fascination—call it what
you will.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine, I have told you, saw her eyes.
Then remembering her presence bowed low
before her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Isabel scanned him, a quick glance, very
comprehensive. Since we have here been
dealing with Nature’s gifts we may well see
those she has accorded our Jester. A lean-limbed
man he was, tall, and very straight.
The face, surrounded by the cap half black,
half white, was bronzed with sun and open air.
The hair hidden beneath it one might well
guess to be dark, judging from the slight
shadow on shaven lip and chin. The nose
was straight, the nostrils sensitive. The
eyes, black-lashed, were of an extraordinary
blueness. Looking in his face you were
aware of vivid colour, and saw that it lay in
his eyes. The pupils were very black. The
mouth, sensitive as the nostrils, was firm-lipped.
The chin, square, was set at a fine
angle with the jaw. Seeking for character you
would have read determination in the line.</p>

<p class='c011'>Isabel was not the only woman who scanned
him. The four maids had their glances ready,—Mary
Chester’s brief but sure; Leonora’s
calm, somewhat indifferent; Monica’s swift,
timid, eyes falling again to the frame of her
embroidery; Brigid’s frank, boyish almost.
But Peregrine’s eyes were still upon Isabel.</p>

<p class='c011'>Isabel looking found novelty. Nor was it
merely the novelty in a new-comer, a novelty
enhanced by dreary weather, enforced sojourn
within doors. In outward form she saw a
Jester, good-looking enough, but merely a
Jester such as his sire and grandsires before
him. Yet for a brief space, swift as the
tongued lightning which shoots across the
darkened sky, she saw something more than
mere fool. And having seen it she perceived
in the fool the cloak to a riddle, a riddle perchance
worth the solving. Yet she gave no
hint of having seen.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your name, Sir Jester?” she demanded,
her eyes now upon the fire, speaking of set
purpose without looking at him, as one may
speak to a servant.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Peregrine, Madam.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Peregrine?” she dwelt on the syllables.
“A bird?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A species of hawk, Madam.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then a bird of prey?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Maybe; yet swift of flight, a wanderer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah! And were you named for prey,
flight, or wanderer?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine lifted his shoulders, the merest
suspicion of a shrug. “The last, so my
mother told me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yet you have not wandered far, nor are
likely to do so.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“True, Madam; yet you speak now of the
body.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The body?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The spirit may soar aloft, wander in
realms of fancy. No man but the owner may
clip the wings of that bird.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You speak seriously for a Jester.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Serious words, Madam, cloak light fancies.
Light words cloak serious fancies. Therefore
you perceive my fancies, being light of wing,
can soar.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!” She threw him a swift glance,
read something sombre in his eyes; remembered,
since a woman’s heart should
surely hold some thought for others, that
death’s hand had but lately touched one near
to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine read her glance; had no mind for
pity in that direction. Death had come as a
good friend to his sire, had flung the cell door
open. Yet how to turn her thought? How
act the part it was his to play? Fate had
indeed flung the rôle upon him, garbed his
body while poorly equipping his tongue. In
this he perceived her irony. Seeking for words
his hand touched his tabor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam, I know a song.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“But one?” Her voice held a hint of
mockery.</p>

<p class='c011'>“For the moment.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A merry song? A sad song?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam, it will accord with the mood of the
listener, therefore I will term it neither a
merry song, nor a sad song, but an adaptable
song.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She leaned back in her chair. “An unusual
song. Let us hear it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine struck a couple of chords on the
tabor, then in a voice not large, but a sweet
barytone, he sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>

      <div class='line in4'><i>So shall thou find thy goal.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The song ended a silence fell on the room.
Mary Chester had heard it very sanely, the
words lost for the most part in the melody
that accompanied them. Leonora, dreaming,
saw the goal of motherhood, though as
yet distant. Monica pictured some peaceful
cloister, heard the sweet tones of the Angelus.
Brigid, half-smiling, sighed; saw, I fancy,
further than did the others.</p>

<p class='c011'>As for Isabel, she looked at the fire.
Pippo, lying on the hearth, looked from her
to Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Whose are the words?” asked Isabel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam, they come from realms of fancy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your own?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Those wherein I have occasionally wandered.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Find you many such songs there?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now and again. They are, however, often
elusive, escaping as soon as perceived.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Isabel turned from the fire, looked full at
him. She gave him now a smile, rare with
her, though Peregrine was not to know that.
His heart beat hotly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Methinks,” she said, “you are poet
rather than Jester.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The colour rushed to Peregrine’s face.
Memory of his resolution surged towards
him, yet was it driven back by the smile that
trembled on her lips.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam, I—” he stammered.</p>

<p class='c011'>Isabel misunderstood the hesitation. She
had seen his sire wince with the new jest
ready on his tongue. Here was no jest ready,
and strangely enough she would cloak the
deficiency.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I—I am not displeased.” The words fell
softly from her lips.</p>

<p class='c011'>And at that laughter sprang to Peregrine’s
throat, a flash of mockery to his eyes, though
he replied gravely enough and meekly,
“Madam, I am at all times what you would
desire me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!” breathed Isabel watching him. Then
very sweetly, “Now I see in you courtier,
yet I would have you poet; therefore, sir poet,
sing again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>And Peregrine sang.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>Some hour or so later, Peregrine departed,
Isabel asked carelessly of her women:</p>

<p class='c011'>“What think you of our Jester?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A very proper man,” quoth Brigid demurely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He has a sweet voice,” ventured Monica
timidly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He differs from his sire,” mused Leonora.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mary Chester alone was silent.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you?” asked Isabel, looking directly
at her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam, I have no opinion,” replied
Mary; and took herself to task for the lie.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch03' class='c006'>CHAPTER III<br /> <br />SWEET BONDAGE</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>SPRING that year made battle royal with
cold winds. Together they fought for
the mastery. Yet where they gained in
strength she gained in insistence. Driven
away she yet returned again and again, till at
length they were weary of the fight, and fled
before her to return no more.</p>

<p class='c011'>The victory hers she reigned supreme and
triumphant, flung her snowy mantle over fruit
trees, kissed to full awakening the flowers in
copse and field, roused to chorus of warblings the
birds’ song in the hedges. Knowing her reign
late and soon to pass to that of summer she lost
no moment of it once established. The south
and west winds, now her subjects, sang softly
among the trees and grasses at her bidding.
The sun, king of all, crowned his reigning queen.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine sat in the castle garden at the
foot of the white sundial which stood at the
edge of the velvet grass sward. Around him
were flower-beds brilliant with colour. Here
were masses of small purple campanula covering
the stone border between flower-bed and
flagged path; clumps of anemones many-hued,
named for St. Brigid; narcissi golden-eyed
trembling in the soft air; forget-me-nots blue
as the sky or Our Lady’s robe; scillas deeper
dyed; tulips chalice-shaped, gold, crimson, and
white,—a very riot of colour, gay as the sweet
mad call of spring.</p>

<p class='c011'>Beyond lay the park, the trees clean and
fresh in their vesture of new leaves; and
beyond that again the open spaces of the
moorland. Peregrine, looking thereat, saw
its freedom, remembered his own. A prisoner
now, he laughed, yet without bitterness.
Ten short weeks to change a man, yet he
found himself changed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine set himself to think. Yet this
he found no easy task. He could see himself
as he was ten weeks agone, fancied the mental
image as clear-cut as a cameo, a good likeness
withal. He could see himself as he was now,
the outlines dimmed truly, blurred by some
curious mist of thought, yet sufficiently clear
to know that here was a different man from
the sharp-cut cameo. To the change, the
manner of its happening, he found it no easy
task to bring clear thought. Once a freeman
scorning all thought of thraldom, now a
prisoner exulting in his bonds. That the
bonds which held him differed from those that
had held his sire he was very certain. Custom
had bound his sire, he had his own word for
it. Here was no custom to hold him, but
bonds infinitely sweeter, light yet inflexible
as iron. He would not be free of them if he
could.</p>

<p class='c011'>What was he? A prisoner in very sooth.
Yet more,—a Jester who failed to jest; a man
seeking for art, for guile, wherein to hide his
heart, yet clothing it ever in truth, though
truth carved to poetic fancy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Dogs are we!” so had cried his sire. No
dog was he to fawn and cringe at the foot of
his mistress, but in very sooth a man kneeling
in adoration at his lady’s shrine. And as he
was, so she accepted him, this Jester who
could not jest. She saw the man beneath the
fool, and stooping from her heights recognized
his manhood. Even so might the Gracious
Mother of God bend from Heaven to a suppliant
son of earth. There was no hint of
blasphemy in his thought; in his very manhood
he was humble.</p>

<p class='c011'>You see in him a man who had had no
thought for women. Two only had held his
love,—his mother, at whose knee in childhood
he had prayed, and that other Mother
to whom his prayers had been addressed,
“<i>Sancta Maria, Mater Dei, ora pro nobis
peccatoribus, nunc et in hora mortis nostræ.</i>”</p>

<p class='c011'>Therefore he brought to his lady a very
clean heart, a very humble heart, one which in
all childlikeness accepted her favours, though
warm with the strength of a man’s devotion
it sang a man’s praises in her honour. You
must not think that he lifted his eyes one whit
higher than the hem of her robe; she was to
him a very queen, himself the humblest of her
subjects. Yet he knew himself now as man,
and no fool, his adoration clean and strong,
no hint of the fawner in his attitude.</p>

<p class='c011'>That the knowledge brought him joy you
may well believe. His heart was attuned to
the joyous note of spring. Sun, the flowering
earth, the soft winds, all were to him but
symbols of his happiness, portraying for him
his lady’s praises. Looking back on his first
meeting with her he still felt a flush of shame
that he had momentarily doubted her truth,
had spoken words that held a note of irony.
For that he struck his breast, cried “<i>Mea
culpa</i>,” saw himself the fool his garb set
forth. Truth incarnate in woman, so he
saw her now, loftily enshrined beside his
mother, the shrine I think very near to that
of the Mother of God. Kneeling afar at
Mass he saw her bend her head in adoration,
rejoiced to think they were at one in this great
Act of Worship. The whiteness of his love
we may well believe lifted him nearer God.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having, then, some hint of his mood you
will know that Peregrine sitting by the sundial
found the morning very fair. Having mused,
and finding it hard to say by what precise
steps he had reached his present goal, he
turned from musing, content merely that here
he was. Light of heart he looked across the
park, saw the shadows lying still and blue
beneath the trees, saw the purple outline of
the moorland, heard a lark pouring forth
exuberant song from the cloudless sky.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the further end of the grass sward, on a
stone bench, Brigid was sitting with Mary
Chester. Embroidery, as their custom was,
occupied their fingers, or it would be safer
to say that Mary’s were occupied thereby.
Brigid for the most part held her needle
idly, her eyes more often roving to the
motionless figure by the sundial than bent
upon her work.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Methinks,” she said suddenly, breaking a
long silence, “that the Lady Isabel favours
our present Jester.” Head on one side
she surveyed the distant figure meditatively,
unashamedly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Lady Isabel is gracious to all,” said
Mary sedately, her eyes upon her embroidery.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hmm.” Brigid’s eyes twinkled. Elbow
on knee, chin in cupped hand, she cast a side-long
look at Mary. “And will you be recording
that small speech at confession.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mary flushed. “I do not understand,”
she responded.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No?” quizzed Brigid. “Oh, Mary, methought
you were a truthful woman. And
here within the space of one minute you have
twice—Oh, fie upon you!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mary, her lips folded upon each other,
stitched at her embroidery.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I wonder,” mused Brigid, unheeding her
companion’s silence, “just what our dear
mistress intends.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Still Mary was silent.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You see,” pursued Brigid, “you know her,
and I know her, and methinks her present
mood is dangerous for the peace of mind of
our friend yonder. Just how far will she lead
him? Just how far will she let him feel her
power? Ah me, had I her looks instead of the
half-hearted dower Dame Nature has bestowed
on me, methinks willy nilly the maid
would enter the field with the mistress, and
should the maid gain the day I’ll warrant the
awakening would be less rude to the sleeping
fool. Mary, a word in your ear. Melikes
that young man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mary raised her eyes from her embroidery.
“And that,” she remarked quietly, “is the
truest word you’ve spoken.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A true word, verily; but I crave leave to
omit the superlative. Let me show the truth
of the other words, emphasise it since you
hesitate to grant it. Therefore firstly, note
our knowledge of the Lady Isabel; secondly,
her mood dangerous to the peace of mind of
our friend yonder; thirdly, the awakening
less rude were it left to me. And firstly,
secondly, and thirdly holds, I’ll warrant,
every whit as much truth as lastly. Hence
I say again, I omit the superlative, by your
leave.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For a moment Mary was still silent. Then
she spoke, her voice grave. “You are barely
charitable, Brigid; and, methinks, hardly
loyal.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Brigid shrugged her shoulders. “As for
loyalty, I do not speak in this fashion save
to you. And for charity—bah! Were I to
divest my speech of all criticism methinks
’twould be as savourless as food without salt
and spices, mere pap for babes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Mary sighed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You sigh, and rightly. Mary, it angers
me. Man though he is, his rôle is but that of
fool,—fool by birth, heritage, and calling.
She is as guarded from him as ever was
Brunhilde from Siegfried by the ring of fire.
He knows it, and she knows it. Yet by the
syren song of her she lures him ever nearer.
And, if her song continues, one day in madness
he will try to pass the barrier of flame. Her
song and madness alone will urge him to the
attempt. Then the flame will burn him; and
I know, yes, I know, she will mock at his
wounds.” Low and fierce Brigid spoke the
last words.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You let imagination run away with you.
You feel too deeply.” Mary’s words were
calm.</p>

<p class='c011'>Brigid looked straight before her. “Sooner
feel too deeply than have a heart of stone.
Mary, I’d sooner be dumb than lure men by
the syren’s song. I’d sooner be featureless
with leprosy than drive men mad by the
fairness of my face. She is heartless as a
stone image, remorseless as a Medusa, a very
vampire to—.” Brigid broke off; a sidelong
glance had shown her Mary’s face. “You are
shocked? Small wonder. Truth is a very
naked lady, and if we drag her from the bottom
of her well we should at least garb her in
becoming fashion. We will lower her again
to the darkness of her well, and herewith
change the topic of our discourse. Mark
you, how blue the sky is, and look at the
white butterfly resting on my anemones
yonder. See the quivering of its wings, the
darling! ’Tis the first I have seen this year.”
Gaiety in every note of the words you could
not have imagined the passionate utterance
of a moment agone.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mary was silent, tears not far from her eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What ails you?” asked Brigid solicitously.</p>

<p class='c011'>Mary smiled wanly. “I liked not the
sight of truth,” she replied.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nor I,” averred Brigid. “’Twas ill to
drag her from her resting-place. Since she
cannot be killed she is best hidden. Let us
cry <i>Deo gratias</i> that there is a well wherein
to hide her. And you and I will dance and
smile at the edge thereof; since, verily, save
for that or moping, which is ill, we can do
nothing.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing,” echoed Mary. “Save pray,”
she added a moment later, and below her
breath.</p>

<p class='c011'>Brigid caught the words, and her eyes gave
assent thereto, if not her lips.</p>

<div class='pbb'>

</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch04' class='c006'>CHAPTER IV<br /> <br />A WOMAN’S WILL</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>HERE you will have seen two views of the
same woman, one from the mountain
summit, rarified, enfolded almost in the very
air of Paradise; the other at the mountain
base, to say the least of the earth earthy.
Justice demands that I show you some third
view of her, and that as dispassionate as may
be. From the three you may chose your own
view, see it perhaps from a <i>via media</i>.</p>

<p class='c011'>And here my task is no easy one, since to
deal with the many intricacies of the human
mind, and above all the mind of a woman,
needs first a clear perception, secondly a
careful adjustment of values, and lastly a
nicety of phrase in setting them forth, that
those to whom I would show them may see
the truth as I believe it, whatever conclusions
they may draw therefrom. Partially to
achieve this object is all I can hope for; if I
give you a glimpse of the truth it must suffice.
The rest I must leave to you, trusting to your
imagination, your power to mould from the
material I will give you. At least I will endeavour
that the material be not too hard
cast; plastic as may be you shall have it.</p>

<p class='c011'>And first, by your leave, I would say this:
I write, it is true, of days now some six hundred
years old, yet human nature has been human
nature from the time of our first parents. It
is a melody composed at the beginning of the
ages; it is repeated throughout the centuries,
the air ever the same, underlying the many
variations woven around it.</p>

<p class='c011'>And now to Isabel. Of her outward seeming
I have shown you, in so far as I am able
with mere pen to portray what should verily
be limned by painter’s art. Of herself, the
inward woman, there is this to say. She
desired power. There, in three words, you
will perceive the keynote. That given we will
on to the further composition. It is by no
means certain how far she knew that she
desired it. We desire air that we may live
and breathe, yet we are not always seeking it,
since it is ever with us; it surrounds us, and we
accept it with no thought on our own part.
Let it be withdrawn and we are conscious of
the lack, go forth to seek it. Power was then
to Isabel as air is to mankind at large. From
childhood—babyhood even—it had been hers
to command. All had been ready to do her
homage, first on account of her beauty, secondly
on account of her charm, since charm
she had. There were those, truly, who
gave her homage somewhat against their own
will, drawn thereto mainly by the example
of others. Belonging to a court it is ill to
stand aloof from the worship the mistress of
the court demands, that worship which her
courtiers freely accord her. And this reason
may well count for thirdly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Full homage then was done to Isabel; the
power she desired was hers for the most part
without effort. Peregrine alone denied it to
her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Personally I see in her neither the heights
now accorded her by Peregrine, nor the
depths her maids saw in her. Had the
heights been hers she surely would have been
indifferent to the thought that one man alone
refused to do her homage; had the depths been
hers she would have borne him malice, set
herself to conquer and then to slay. But
there was not then, I believe, any definite
thought of ill towards him. Of later I am
none so sure. It was merely the fruit beyond
her reach which had excited her desire. Peregrine
the Jester, whose presence she had first
demanded with the same indifference she had
times out of number demanded the presence
of his sire, had, from the moment of his
entrance, stirred interest in her. She saw in
him, as you have already seen, something
more than Jester. The perception was elusive
enough to bring the interest to full awakening,
to set it as it were on the scent of something
further to be discovered. She had heard his
song, had seen his face, and had read therein,
something of a challenge, or perhaps more
rightly had seen a barrier thrown down by the
man.</p>

<p class='c011'>“As fool I give you my allegiance,” she
might have heard him say. “In that rôle
you shall exact from me your due to the
uttermost farthing. One iota beyond you
shall never gain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In imagery she had seen him standing aloof,
proud, cold, very sure that as man he would
never bend the knee to her. Outwardly his
rôle should be as perfect as might be, a very
skilled art of play-acting, every entrance
exact to time, every word carefully conned,
faultlessly delivered. She saw him here
forcing her to play the part he would assign
to her; to deliver, half unconsciously, the
speeches that would bring from him the
response he desired to make. The very
knowledge that he would have the power to
do this drew admiration from her, and I am
by no means sure that the admiration was
grudging. Yet Jester on the stage, he would
be man in the wings, smiling at his own skill,
mocking at her. This knowledge tantalized,
stung, brought her will swiftly yet lightly to
the fray. To my thinking this shows her
very shallow: her charm I have never denied.</p>

<p class='c011'>To the mere onlooker the conflict may well
seem ignoble, unworthy one of her degree.
Yet she saw it in other fashion. Rank,
degree, sank for the time being into abeyance.
It became the conflict—though lightly undertaken—for
a soul that had denied her power.
Ignoble we may well call it for the one
who recognised the conflict, yet ignoble in
other meaning than her courtiers might have
termed it. It would be, too, no open fight
with trumpet call to battle, lances displayed.
In such she might well see herself worsted.
The castle of the man’s soul must be approached
by soft stealth. Guile must take
the place of sword and spear.</p>

<p class='c011'>And Peregrine had no hint of that which
was about to befall; there was the pity of it.
Forewarned might have been forearmed. It
is very true that his father’s words had caused
him to enclose his soul within a castle, from
which, he held, none should lure it forth.
Should one use the terms of parable one might
name the castle pride. Without, his soul
might have had clearer view of approaching
dangers. Within, believing himself secure,
he saw not the guile which crept towards the
walls.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet direct speech rather than parable will
best serve us in the pursuance of the matter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Isabel the woman brought every woman’s
art—and of these not one was lacking her—to
conquer Peregrine the man. You have
seen the result. I have not given you the
details of the conflict nor will do so. Though
truly to call it a conflict when never once was
seen the flash of naked steel seems somewhat
of an anomaly. Isabel’s art in this matter
would need great skill to set forth. Perchance
after some fashion I might show it
you were I so minded, yet will I leave it to
your imagination. To know the wiles by
which a man’s spirit is enslaved is not the
most pleasing of knowledge. It certainly
holds somewhat of sadness, even possibly of
distaste.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine saw no ill in the enslaving, held
himself a willing captive; while Isabel for
the moment found pleasure in her captive.
Recognizing his capitulation it amused her
to reward him with many favours. At the
present, too, he interested her. She felt his
strength, saw in his mind much that she had
not yet fully fathomed. That fact pleased
her, left her with the possibility of discovery.
The joy in the possession of an empty casket,
however fair it may be exteriorly, soon palls.
One containing much has ever interest. Its
contents may be examined at leisure, there is
ever that to be found, probably the unexpected,
possibly treasure.</p>

<p class='c011'>You see now how matters stand at the
moment. Therefore we will on with the
further story.</p>

  <h2 id='ch05' class='c006'>CHAPTER V<br /> <br />GOOD COMRADESHIP</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>PIPPO the Page had struck up a friendship
with Peregrine the Jester. It had been,
I take it, a case of friendship at first sight. A
merry youngster was Pippo, saucy after the
manner of boys, yet winning for all that. He
alone of the court was no slave to Isabel; he
did her bidding as it behooved him, yet indifferent
to her charms, while she for her part
saw in him a very child, not worth her conquest.
Later we might hear a different tale.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pippo had much the same love for the open
as had Peregrine in boyhood, and still had for
that matter. Yet Pippo’s rambles had taken
him but seldom beyond the garden and the
park. Now, with Peregrine as guide, the
two frequently escaped from the more cultured
enclosure, made for the woods, the moorlands.
Here Pippo learned to see with new eyes, and
truly spring is the most welcome season for
the learning.</p>

<p class='c011'>With Peregrine, then, for master, with the
fair earth for school, with sweet springtime
for the hour, Pippo made vast progress in
conning Nature’s book. Under this master’s
tuition it ever held for the boy something
truly akin to magic. With unerring divination
he had been led to the hollows where the
first primrose bloomed, where the first wind-flower
swayed its fragile head in the breeze,
and this long before the majority of mortals
had a hint of blossoming and burgeoning.
Later, together they had gazed at the marvel of
cup-shaped nest in forked branch or sunny
bank, seen therein the eggs blue or mottled
brown as the case might be.</p>

<p class='c011'>Once in the earlier hours of their friendship,
it being then, I fancy, not eight days old, the
two had fallen in with an aged shepherd, one
blowy evening of sleet and rain. Together
they had gone a-lambing with him, scouring
the darkling fields for the scattered ewes, their
ears alert to the cry of the new-born lambs.
Here Peregrine had been the surest guide, the
quickest to catch the cry of the life new-born.
Once started on their work they had remained
at it throughout the night. By good fortune
rather than good management their absence
from the Castle went undetected; yet it was
a matter not to be repeated, since the next
day Pippo’s eyes were heavy with sleep, his
brain too drowsy for his duties, whereby he
incurred, and not unnaturally, his mistress’s
displeasure. The arduous task consolidated
their friendship. It was a friendship wherein,
if there was unbounded admiration on the
boy’s side, there was something very akin to
gratitude on the man’s.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet the greatest wonder of all in Pippo’s
eyes was the way of Peregrine with the wild
creatures of wood and field. To see the birds
come at his call, perch on hand and shoulder,
sing therefrom as from a very post of vantage,
to watch the dormice, the squirrels awakened
from their winter sleep come fearlessly up to
him, this indeed was marvel, and marvel to be
held in secret bond between them. There
was half the joy of it. None but they two
knew of their sweet intimacy with Nature’s
special creatures, those on whom no man had
laid the lightest touch of civilization.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine, too, was a wonderful <i>raconteur</i>
of tales, ofttimes in verse, ever bathed in
fancy. He could translate to the boy’s enraptured
ears the song the thrush sang to his
mate in the golden morning hours, the secrets
whispered by the wind as it moved among the
fir trees, or through the rushes by the margin
of some brook,—very children both of them
in mind, with hearts as young as the sweet
springtime around them.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>One April evening the two sat together on a
grassy hillside. Behind them was a copse of
hollies, firs, and beeches, a copse of deep undergrowth
and green moss. On its margin stood
a cherry tree, the wealth of its snowy blossoms
backgrounded by a holly bush. Pippo had
robbed the tree of a portion of its wealth. It
lay beside him in long graceful boughs burdened
with white flowers and tender pink-brown
leaves. To the left on the southern
slope of the hill were massed primroses, and
early bluebells, pushing forth among spiked
leaves. Scattered at their feet and adown
the grassy hill were cuckoo-flowers, their tiny
petals most faintly tinged with pinkish purple.
Before them lay the channel, blue in the
luminous haze which hung over land and
water.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The swallows have returned,” quoth Peregrine,
as propped on elbow he gazed out to
sea.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where?” demanded Pippo staring around
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They are not here at the moment,”
laughed Peregrine. “I saw them this morning
from my chamber window passing in
flocks across the sky.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!” breathed Pippo envious. “I would
that I had seen them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou wert sleeping, young lazy bones,”
teased Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pippo gazed straight before him with ardent
eyes. “Tomorrow I will awake at daybreak,
an hour at least before sunrise,” he asseverated.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And to what end?” demanded Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To look for swallows passing in flocks
across the sky,” quoth Pippo dreamily. Then,
turning, he put a question. “How think you
they know, far away beyond England, that
here the winter is passed and summer is at
hand?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine smiled, musing. “How should
I give thee an answer as to the thoughts of
swallows. Perchance the Blessed Virgin
whispers to them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Pippo eyed him. Albeit he had now known
Peregrine some ten weeks and more it came
ever fresh to his mind that he spoke on occasions
more as woman or monk than man.
The men of the court were more ready to take
the name of God and His Son on their lips
in light oath than speak with tenderness of
Our Lady and the Saints. The boy saw in
this fashion something of a sign of manhood,
in which he found Peregrine strangely lacking.
Yet noting the virile strength of the man, the
firm swelling of his muscles beneath the close
hose and tunic as he moved to sitting posture
on the grass, Pippo saw in him—had his
thoughts found clear interpretation—something
of an anomaly. He had already endured
some light mockery for his friendship with the
Jester, which—though bringing a quick flush
to his cheek—shook his friendship not at all.
The loyalty of a child is a very enduring
loyalty.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of what thinkest thou?” demanded
Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nothing,” returned Pippo untruly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine smiled, yawned, stretched his
long lean limbs, and rose from the grass.
“Let’s onward,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pippo scrambled to his feet. Picking up his
spoils of the cherry tree he held them sheaf-like
in his arms, a fragrant snowy burden.
Together they descended the grassy slope,
came through a gap in a hedge, and out into
a lane beyond.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a time they walked in silence. Now and
again Peregrine glanced at the boy beside him,
his head half hidden in the flower sheaf he
bore. It was not the first time that Pippo had
borne home cherry blossom in his arms. The
flower had become associated in Peregrine’s
mind with these his days of radiant joy. You
see his heart very full of sentiment; also he
was young.</p>

<p class='c011'>They had traversed some mile or so of the
lane in this silence, when suddenly to their
ears came the shrill yelp of an animal in pain.
The yelp was followed by another and yet
another, rising to a sound that had in it an
almost human shriek of agony.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some brute is ill-treating a dog,” quoth
Peregrine, and he set off at a run, Pippo close
at his heels.</p>

<p class='c011'>A couple of hundred yards further on the
road turned sharply to the right to an open
space of grass. Standing on the grass was a
thick-set swarthy-looking fellow, knotted ash
stick in one hand, while swinging from the
other was a small mongrel dog, bleeding
and broken. The stick was doing deadly
work.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Brute!” cried Pippo his cheeks scarlet.
Peregrine’s face was white.</p>

<p class='c011'>The fellow started, the stick falling momentarily
idle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The cur bit me,” he muttered, casting an
evil look towards them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Knowing you the greater cur.” Pippo
heard an unaccustomed note in Peregrine’s
voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go you into the field,” said Peregrine
shortly, pointing to a gate. Pippo, hearing
the tone of command, scuttled through it
like a frightened rabbit.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet once through he was all for seeing the
turn of matters on the other side the hedge.
Cherry blossom deposited on the ground he
scrambled to the top of the bank. Clinging
to the bushes he peered through.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!” breathed Pippo, joy in the soft
sound.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bah! he need not have feared for Peregrine’s
manhood. He hugged himself for glee, thereby
nearly slithering backwards down the
slippery bank. For the first few seconds the
tussle was short and fierce, then actual conflict
gave place to naught but well-merited punishment.
Peregrine’s heart had flamed to a
white heat of fury. Five minutes later he
flung the fellow free. With an oath the man
slunk off staggering adown the way the two
had come.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine crossed to the small bundle of
palpitating pain by the ditch side. Pippo
saw his face. He slipped down from the bank,
his heart beating hotly. He heard now what
had before escaped him, the small shuddering
moans of pain. Then there was another sound.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pippo,” called Peregrine a moment later.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pippo grabbed up his cherry blossom and
came through the gate.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come on,” said Peregrine somewhat
shortly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pippo fell into step beside him, yet with one
anxious backward glance towards the ditch.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The dog is out of pain,” said Peregrine
kindly. And Pippo drew a deep breath.</p>

<p class='c011'>They still pursued their way in silence; at
the moment words would not, I fancy, have
come easily to either of them. Peregrine’s
face was still stern; Pippo’s, if you must know,
once more gleeful, something of a grin depicted
on it. Since the victor had, it would
appear, no vast satisfaction in the matter of
the recent encounter, it behooved Pippo to
have satisfaction for him, and this he had,
very thoroughly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Coming nearer the castle they found themselves
by the church. The door was set
wide open. It was hard upon the hour for
Complin. Here Peregrine paused.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shall we enter?” he said, and passed
through the porch.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pippo followed him nothing loath, composing
the muscles of his face into an expression
better suited to the sacredness of the place.
Since Peregrine had a mind to pray, pray he
might. His own will in the matter might now
be safely accorded him. In Pippo’s eyes he
had proved himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pippo dropped on one knee before the
hanging pyx, followed Peregrine into the
dark oak pew. He saw the candles gleaming
on the altar, their light commingling with the
waning evening light. And over all was the
quiet awe, the brooding stillness of the Hidden
Presence.</p>

<p class='c011'>A moment or so later a long line of monks
entered the church, passed leisurely into the
stalls.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Jube, domne, benedicere</i>,” began the
reader.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Noctem quietam, et finem perfectum concedat
nobis Dominus omnipotens</i>,” came the
blessing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pippo glanced momentarily sideways at
Peregrine’s profile, saw his face peaceful,
grave. A wave of sudden warmth struck on
the boy’s heart, a new admiration for the
man beside him. He saw in him a fighting
saint, a very St. George, protector of the weak
and defenceless. Such another would he be
himself in manhood, loving Christ and His
Mother, champion of all wrong. The warmth
at his heart brought a glow to his cheeks. The
thought of his friendship raised him in his
own estimation, which for that matter was
at all times none so low. Anon he caught
the sung words.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Irascimini, et nolite peccare....</i>”</p>

<p class='c011'>To the context he paid little heed. Here
again he saw Peregrine, saw him angered yet
without sin, thrashing a very burly fellow
soundly. Pippo, I fear me, paid but scant
attention to the service; Peregrine absorbed
his mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>Later a movement brought him back to his
surroundings. The monks were crossing to
the statue of the Madonna, there to end the
week with an antiphon in her honour. Somewhat
tardily Pippo recognized his wandering
thoughts.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Salve Regina, Mater misericordiæ</i>,” he
sang, his clear treble joining with the deeper
voices, seeking to do atonement by the lustiness
of his present singing. He gave full ear
to the prayer that followed; crossed himself
devoutly at the words, <i>Divinum auxilium
maneat semper nobiscum</i>. Nevertheless his
conscience pricked him somewhat.</p>

<p class='c011'>The monks passed back into the sacristy.
The candles on the altar were extinguished;
the church was now in twilight, through
which shone the soft red glow of the pyx-light.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine moved; and Pippo rose from his
knees. Half way down the aisle he paused,
slipped behind Peregrine, went back to the
statue of Our Lady. At her feet he deposited
his burden of cherry blossom, glanced up a
moment half shyly at the tender face above
him. Then turning swiftly he joined Peregrine
without.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine, full of thought, had not noticed
his absence. It was not till they were at the
castle gates that he spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What hast thou done with the cherry
blossom?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pippo nodded his head backwards. “Oh,
I left it down there,” he replied airily enough.
But he did not say that the snowy flowers lay
before the Madonna as a small token of penitence
for his wandering thoughts. Instead he
spoke on a sudden in very different fashion.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Feel my muscle,” he said gravely, doubling
back his arm.</p>

  <h2 id='ch06' class='c006'>CHAPTER VI<br /> <br />BALDA THE WITCH</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>THE days passed leisurely up at the castle,
naught of vast import to mark their
flight. June was now in, the month of roses,
with long sunny days, with nights of brief
duration.</p>

<p class='c011'>Isabel, finding time hang somewhat heavy
on her hands, turned yet closer attention to
our Jester. Her interest in him had not
waned; I am by no means sure that it had not
increased. Recognizing his homage, she yet
felt there was that in him which eluded her.
Seeking to discover it she found herself
baffled. While tantalizing it yet spurred her
to further interest. Musing on the thought
in her idle hours the desire to discover that
which eluded her became somewhat of an
obsession. She carried it with her throughout
the day, took it to her couch as bedfellow.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her women in these days found her ill to
please. The dowager of them, one time in
sort her nurse, now an old dame who seldom
left her own chamber, never the castle, prescribed
<i>tisanes</i> for her health, noxious concoctions
of which the chief ingredient was the
liquid from stewed rosemary, a mightily unpleasant
herb to the palate. Mary would
have her walk abroad, try fresh designs for
her embroidery; and for my part I find her
simple prescription wholesome. Leonora
frankly saw mere ill-temper in her peevishness.
Monica said rosaries for her, and truly prayer
may take effect where all else fails. Brigid,
very observant, said little, offered no remedies,
but none the less she thought a good
deal, fancied at one moment her thoughts
were to some purpose, the next was none so
sure of it. And then the clue came to her
hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>I know not how Isabel’s mind began to
turn upon the wise woman, so reputed, who
dwelt in a mud-walled hovel in a distant combe
among the moors. Perchance she happened
at this time to catch some whisper of her from
an over-credulous serving-wench; perchance
the knowledge of the old crone’s whereabouts
had been with her before this, and now recurred
fresh to her mind. Certain it is that
Isabel, brooding, saw possibility of aid in
that quarter. The notion was unquestionably
prompted by foolishness, probably by something
more evil. Once presented it conjoined
with her former thought, not to leave. This,
too, was a thought which might be brought to
deed. Seeing this Isabel was ready to act.
It was not her way to dally when she saw
possibility before her.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>One night sleep forsook Brigid’s couch.
Lying wide-eyed and wakeful an oppression
fell upon her, not wholly of evil, yet something
of that brand. Whispering an <i>Ave</i> she sought
to free herself from it, yet to no purpose.
<i>Paternosters</i>, the Sign of the Cross alike
availed her naught. Moved by a sudden
impulse she rose from her bed, went to the
window.</p>

<p class='c011'>Below her lay the garden bathed in quiet
light. Beyond the shadow close beneath her
window she could see clearly the expanse of
turf, the gravel paths, the flower beds, all
softly illumined in the moon-rays. Very still
she watched, believing there was something
about to happen, yet unknowing what it might
be. At what exact moment a figure emerged
from the shadow below her window Brigid
knew not; suddenly she saw it, dark-robed,
standing on the turf. For the space of a
heart’s beat the thought of some earth-bound
spirit, some poor wandering ghost flashed to
her mind, caused her a second’s tremor. Yet
a tremor succeeded verily by a greater shock.
The figure turned, glanced momentarily towards
the windows of the castle. Brigid saw
the face clearly outlined in the moonlight, saw,
too, in the movement one fearful of detection.</p>

<p class='c011'>Swift as lightning she turned towards the
room, threw garments upon herself with never
a thought to their careful donning, slipped
down the stairs and out into the soft June
night. Here the garden lay silent, slumbering,
no hint of restless figure to disturb its peace.
Some might have believed themselves dreaming,
illusioned, yet Brigid was very sure of her
wakefulness, her sanity. Her mind brought
quick to bear on possibilities she bethought
her of the wicket gate beyond the lime trees,
which led to the tiny copse fringing at that
part the parkland. It would afford cover to
one desirous of crossing the park unperceived
by any watcher from the castle.</p>

<p class='c011'>Brigid entered the copse. Here it was
nearly dark, the moon-rays struggling fitfully
through the thick-leaved branches overhead.
Hastening, yet warily, fearful of coming too
close upon the pursued and thereby discovering
her pursuit, she made her way along the
path, her ears alert to catch the sound of
snapped twig ahead. Fearing imprudence she
somewhat overdid her care, since, reaching the
edge of the copse, she saw the figure far across
the parkland, vanishing up the distant rise.</p>

<p class='c011'>Brigid caught up her dress, sped forward
hot-footed. Two thoughts were in her mind
as she ran; one, that had she been closer on the
scent there had been danger of the figure
turning, and thereby detecting her in the open
space of park, the trees being set wide apart;
the other, that, should the pursued attain to the
cross-roads up yonder before she once more
gained sight of her, the scent would be truly
lost, pursuit well-nigh hopeless, since of the
end of this midnight roaming she had no inkling.
This latter thought in mind she called
the saints to her aid, and sped the faster.
Though sound of wind and limb she was
breathless as she breasted the top of the rise,
had perforce to pause a moment’s space; then
she was on again, this time along a road. Turning
a bend of it some hundred yards or so from
the crossways, she saw the figure ahead of her,
and thereupon put up a fervent thanksgiving.
Slacking speed on the instant she crept cautiously
along in the shadow of the hedge,
keeping to the rough grass close below it,
fearful lest the sound of her footfall should
betray her pursuit.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the cross-roads the figure turned to the
left, Brigid following warily enough. The
pace now giving time for reflection other than
of mere pursuit, she fell to marvelling what
this mad ramble portended. Had she not observed
the half-scared glance towards the
Castle she might have deemed Isabel sleep-walking,
but having seen it this chance notion
was dismissed with no second thought. There
was purpose in this journey, and that a very
definite one. But what purpose? Brigid
cudgelled her brains to no end. A less clean
mind than hers might have seen some dishonourable
meeting ahead. Of such she had
no thought. Frankly puzzled she found no
solution of the riddle. Of what aid she might
be in the matter afoot she thought not then
any more than she had thought at the outset.
Possibly at first curiosity had pricked her to
the pursuit, though to my thinking it was
chiefly some unconscious instinct of protection.</p>

<p class='c011'>Presently the road divided, leftwards descending
in a gentle decline, to the right
branching in a rough track across the moorland.
Isabel turned to the right. Dodging in
the shadow of gorse bushes Brigid followed her.
Verily must the matter on hand be of great
moment. For no mere wild goose chase could
Isabel be pursuing this desolate path at night.
Dawning fatigue in a degree dulling interest
Brigid began to experience some slight tremor
at the loneliness to which she had come. The
moorland stretched before her and on either
hand, a vast undulating space broken by gorse
bushes, distantly fringed by woods lying like
dark patches in the moonlight. Once, far to
the right, she caught a glimpse of moving
antlers, where a herd of deer roamed among
the heather. Awe at the silence and stillness
clutched at her heart. Again she cried upon
the saints. If you will believe me, Brigid gave
them scant rest that night.</p>

<p class='c011'>Topping a rise Isabel began to descend.
Here the descent was steep, fell swiftly to a
combe bottomed by a small copse. By the
quickened pace of her Brigid believed she saw
her journey’s end in sight. Her own heart
beat faster; fatigue in part forgotten, interest
stirred anew.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the bottom of the combe she saw a light,
steady in the shadow under the hillside.
Where there is a light there must needs be
some creature to kindle the light; this was
Brigid’s judging. Yet who should dwell in
that lonely place? And why, greater matter
for surmise, should Isabel seek the dweller
there? That she did seek him or her was
very certain, since unfaltering she made her
way towards the light. It came, Brigid now
marked, from a mud hovel; the flame gleamed
yellow through an aperture in the wall.</p>

<p class='c011'>Isabel went up to the door, knocked. Brigid
crouched breathless in the shadow of a bush.
On the instant the flame was extinguished.
The aperture sank back into the darkness of
the wall. Brigid caught the murmur of Isabel’s
voice speaking. The door was opened
cautiously. In the space she saw a woman’s
figure, bent, the head thrust forward. The
moonlight falling on her face showed her of
great age. The toothless mouth trembled
and mumbled; the bleary eyes peered upwards
from deep sockets; scant white locks fell across
them. There came to her ear a further low
murmur of words. Next Isabel entered the
hovel; the door was shut.</p>

<p class='c011'>Brigid sprang to her feet, the riddle well-nigh
answered. Witchery of some sort Isabel
had come to seek, white or black, it mattered
little. White, it turned black in the fingering;
black, it changed to very filth. Here she
read the meaning of the oppression which had
fallen upon her, which had held her wakeful.</p>

<p class='c011'>“St. Brigid to her aid and mine,” she
whispered, making for the window, peering
cautiously within. To make her presence
known, to attempt persuasion in the matter,
would be worse than fruitless; that she well
knew. She had not served Isabel three years
for nothing.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her chin level with the window ledge, her
eyes sought the interior of the hovel. In the
dim glow of a peat fire she saw the room; a
bare place enough, mud-floored, full of cobwebs
and the thick scent of peat smoke. This
scent and others more unwholesome caused
a very vile odour. In one corner was a heap
of heather and dried skins; across another,
suspended by a frayed rope, hung a tattered
curtain. A table, a bench, a chair on which
sat Isabel, a stool for the hag, made up the
furniture of the place.</p>

<p class='c011'>The two were sitting by the hearth; Isabel
upright, distaste very much in her bearing;
the hag crouching towards the fire, holding
claw-like hands to the warmth, muttering the
while. Presently the muttering gave place
to words.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Greed, greed,” came the mumbled speech.
“Thou hast much; what more dost thou
desire?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That which eludes me.” The sound of
the even, familiar voice in the vile-smelling
place caused Brigid’s heart to beat anew.</p>

<p class='c011'>Balda the Witch laughed, a very mirthless
sound, harsh as the scraping of iron on flint.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Wait, then,” she mumbled, straightening
herself on the stool.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the horrid silence Brigid stared towards
the motionless figures, breath suspended. Her
will beating back the horror that was creeping
over her, she assured herself that this was
foolishness in the guise of evil; yet the assurance
brought her no vast solace. Further she
told herself, being sane and healthy of mind,
that it was the excitement of the midnight
journey, the silence around her, which had
wrought her nerves to a pitch of imagination,
caused her to fancy darkness other than mere
shadow lurking in the corners. Yet, for all
that, she found herself whispering, “<i>Scuto
circumdabit te veritas ejus: non timebis a timore
nocturno</i>.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For a space the silence endured, how long
she knew not, having ceased to be aware of the
passing moments. Then on a sudden came a
sibilant murmur, seemingly from so great a
distance that it was with fresh horror she
realized it issued from one of the motionless
figures by the hearth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That which thou dost desire is above thee.
Yet must thou stoop to obtain it. Thus, and
thus only canst thou grasp it, to wrest it from
the Power where it lies.” The voice stopped.
A moment’s silence followed on the words.
Then once more came the voice, rising like a
cry forced from an unwilling throat. “Yet
who, with impunity, shall war with God?
I, even I, Balda the Witch, say to thee,
Beware.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Once more the silence fell. Brigid clutched
the window ledge with shaking hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This is all foolishness to the verge of madness,”
she whispered. A certain loyalty to
Isabel, and, I fancy, terror lest the mere
mention of her dread should draw it nearer,
constrained her use of a harsher phrase.</p>

<p class='c011'>Balda’s figure relaxed from its rigid pose.
Bending once more towards the fire she fell
again to mumbling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Art frighted?” She stretched out one
skinny claw, laid it on Isabel’s wrist. “Good;
I feel no tremor. Pride and desire should
carry thee far along the road I have traversed.
The hand is moist and cool. There is no fear
here such as kneels quaking at the window.”
On the words she turned, pointing a palsied
finger. Her red-rimmed eyes, deep in their
sockets, looked straight at Brigid.</p>

<p class='c011'>Had Brigid but known how nigh on empty
of sight were those bleared terrible eyes, she
had ducked below the window on the instant,
made for the copse, and so escaped. Knowing
it not, and seeing full accusation and discovery
in the pointing finger, she knelt on, startled,
turned to stone by the swiftness of the
happening.</p>

<p class='c011'>A moment at a loss for Balda’s meaning
Isabel still gazed at the fire, then realizing, she
turned, saw the white wide-eyed face at the
window.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Brigid!” she cried, her voice on a harsh
note of anger.</p>

<p class='c011'>Isabel went straight to the door. Without
she confronted Brigid risen from her knees.
The two faced each other in the moonlight.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Spy,” said Isabel; that and no more.</p>

<p class='c011'>Brigid, chin raised, uttered no word. She
looked very straight at Isabel, who cared not
to meet her eyes. There was certainly no
shame in them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Balda the Witch peered from the doorway.
Well-nigh devoid of sight she scented the
mental atmosphere, found that in the one
woman ill-suited to her liking. Momentarily
her spirit cowered. Muttering an oath she
withdrew, slammed the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shall we return?” said Isabel silkily.</p>

  <h2 id='ch07' class='c006'>CHAPTER VII<br /> <br />SANCTUARY</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>THE Lady Abbess of Sangdieu, having
heard vespers, was about to return to her
own chamber, when word was brought her
that one Mistress Brigid Carlisle was in the
parlour seeking audience of her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My niece!” said the Abbess surprised, and
startled for the moment from her customary
equability of bearing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Even so, Reverend Mother,” replied the
nun. “She has ridden hence it would seem
from some distance, attended but by a couple
of serving men.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!” quoth the Abbess pondering. Then
briefly, “Tell my niece I will be with her
presently.” Thereupon the nun withdrew.</p>

<p class='c011'>A handsome old lady was this Abbess of
Sangdieu; a rigid disciplinarian, stern, yet with
no small strain of tenderness in her heart when
you had found your way to it. Exceeding just,
methinks she carried her sternness further
towards herself than towards those over whom
she had the rule. Of high rank, and very
well-bred in courtesy that virtue extended
itself throughout her domain; flowing naturally
from the head it permeated those under her.
Also, and this grace is by no means as common
as some men would have us believe, she
possessed humour. Descending to the parlour
she found Brigid therein, white-faced
and travel worn.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, child,” she said, giving her cheek to
be kissed, “and what brings you here?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The desire for sanctuary,” said Brigid very
weary.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha!” The old lady glanced sharply at
her, read fatigue in every feature. Hospitality
stirred quick within her. “First you must
eat,” she said. “Your story, for I see you
have one, will keep. I will hear it anon.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ringing a handbell, which was answered
by a lay sister, she ordered food and wine to be
brought. While waiting for its coming she
put a question.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How came you hither?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“On horseback,” replied Brigid. “The
two men who rode with me are housing in
the village. They will return at daybreak.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah,” mused the Lady Abbess. And a
silence fell on the parlour.</p>

<p class='c011'>A pleasant place it was, long and narrow,
redolent of the cleanly smell of beeswax. The
floor, very polished, bespoke good work with
that material on the part of the lay sisters.
Three windows looked on to the garden. Roses
climbing round them nodded crimson and
yellow heads towards the room, their scent
mingling with the smell of the beeswax. At
one end was an open hearth, above which, on
the wall, hung a white Figure on an ebony
cross. A couple of pictures, some half-dozen
chairs, and a deal table much scrubbed, made
up the furniture. Bare enough truly, yet
breathing an atmosphere of homeliness and
peace. Brigid found in it a very haven of
rest. Her tensioned nerves began to relax.</p>

<p class='c011'>The lay sister appearing with a tray the
Abbess roused herself to briskness. “Come,
child, you must eat. Your face is as white as
a kerchief. I would fain see a little colour in
your cheeks.”</p>

<p class='c011'>While Brigid plied her knife and fork, she
fell to studying her breviary, judging, and
rightly, the girl would fare better deeming
herself unwatched. Nevertheless her eyes
were not wholly occupied with the book.
What she saw in Brigid’s face caused her some
perplexity, though her manner gave no inkling
of it. It was seldom the Lady Abbess’s
way to speak of what she saw; never on the
instant. This gave time for seeing further,
for weighing and for judging accurately.
Thoughts surprised by another before they
have come to full purpose have a way of
taking sudden flight. Fearful of capture they
fly on approach, and thereby good may be
lost. The meal ended she laid the book aside.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Now,” she said, speaking cheerfully, “canst
tell me thy story? Thy face is somewhat
less like a washed-out dish-cloth.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Lady Isabel desires my services no
longer,” replied Brigid briefly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed!” The Abbess’s tone was somewhat
grim. “And for what reason doth she
no longer require them?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have displeased her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!” The old Abbess bent eagle eyes
upon the girl. “And is her displeasure just?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I trow not,” said Brigid very low.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell me,” said the Abbess briefly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Brigid looked towards the windows.
Through them, in the quiet garden, she saw
two nuns walking. Beyond lay a yew hedge;
beyond that again a low line of hills, blue
against the sky. A thrush was singing in
an elm tree.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tell me,” repeated the Abbess.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam, the story in its entirety is hers,
not mine. I saw that which she desired not
that I should see; I heard that which she desired
not that I should hear. She was my
mistress. For three years I received kindness
at her hands. Therefore, for the telling,
what I have said must suffice.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Abbess nodded. Her mouth took on
a line of grim approval. She liked loyalty.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good; it shall suffice. And now what do
you propose?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“To remain here.” Brigid’s voice was
steady, though her face flushed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah! And in what capacity?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam, as nun.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The old Abbess looked up verily surprised.
“Hoity toity, child; a nun is not made in a
moment. ’Tis a question of vocation.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I seek mine.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Abbess pondered. “The desire is
sudden.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“When God has a door to open methinks
He can throw it wide on the moment an’ He
will. ’Tis every whit as simple to His power
as a piecemeal opening.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Abbess chuckled inwardly. She found
in her niece’s character something very akin
to her own. Yet she replied gravely enough.
“’Tis true; yet must we be sure ’tis God’s
Hand on the door and not our own.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That,” quoth Brigid very calmly, “may
later be judged by you and the novice mistress.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Again the Abbess smiled, this time openly.
“You go apace, child. We have not yet
decided to accept you for your postulancy.
True, from the world’s standpoint, you have
no permission to ask save mine, since your
parents are dead,—God rest their souls. Well,
well, we must see. My Lord Cardinal Falconieri
proposes honouring the Minster with a
visit some ten days hence. We will have his
opinion on the matter. Till then certainly
thou must bide here. Thou lookest as if the
quiet of our house will stand thee in no ill
stead.” Then rising, “Come with me,” she
said. “I will take thee to thy chamber.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She led the way along cool passages, up
wide oak stairs. Opening a door she entered
a room facing west. The sun, not yet fully
waning, poured through the window. It lay
golden along the floor and on the white-washed
walls. Brigid looked around her. Here was
the same peace, the same homeliness she had
found in the parlour below.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are very good to me, Madam,” she
said, her voice faintly a-tremble.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tut, child. Art thou not my own kin?
Yet wert thou the veriest stranger I must
needs give thee shelter, since thereby I might
be entertaining an angel unawares. Not that
I find thee exceeding like to one. I know thee
and thy madcap ways over well for that
mistake. Mind, child, no word of this thy
purpose to any save myself. Now I will send
Sister Bona to see that thou hast all necessaries.
Haste thee to thy couch, child; thou art sadly
weary. Christ have thee in His keeping.”
This time she offered not her own cheek for
salute, but kissed the girl on the forehead.
Then she left her.</p>

<p class='c011'>On her departure Brigid crossed to the
window, stood awhile looking out, yet with
unseeing eyes.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch08' class='c006'>CHAPTER VIII<br /> <br />COUNCIL AT SANGDIEU</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>HIS Eminence John Felix Maria Cardinal
Falconieri having arrived at the Minster
with such dignity of retinue as befitted a
Prince of the Church, was closetted with the
Lady Abbess.</p>

<p class='c011'>A small, very old man this Lord Cardinal, at
first sight you would have seen nothing remarkable
in him. On first sight, I say, and
that advisedly. Looking again, an’ you were
so minded, you would have guessed aristocracy
in the thin-featured face, read kindliness
in the mouth, shrewdness in the eyes, intellect
in the forehead, and I am very sure determination
in the chin. Had you received
speech of him, you would have left mere surmise
for certainty, and have added thereto a
knowledge of his personality, his power.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet, for all that, you would have found him
what he truly was, exceeding simple hearted.
A stately progress, much retinue, irked him
hugely. Yet he suffered the irksomeness on
occasions, urged thereto by his chaplain, who
recognized the dignity of his master vastly
better than did the master himself; who held
also that he knew very well what was good
for both spiritual prince and subject. This
prince’s pleasure, and one he occasionally
indulged in, was to escape in a manner temporarily
from his rank in the Roman hierarchy,
play <i>incognito</i> the part of simple priest.</p>

<p class='c011'>There was a certain little church set on the
edge of a forest, above a village containing
some few hundred souls. Here at times he
found the sheer simplicity he desired. Its
priest dismissed to gain recreation an’ he
would in some wider sphere, the Cardinal took
upon himself his duties. Here he said his daily
Mass to the sound of the wind which whispered
or shrilled through the forest trees according
to the season, assoiled the souls of the village
folk, gave them the Body of Christ to their
refreshment; while never a breath of his true
title got afloat. As Father Felix he was known
among them; and, if you will believe me, they
looked to his coming very willingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>This little matter is not one which is set
forth by his biographers. Had they got wind
on it they would doubtless have fashioned a
very pretty tale therefrom, garnished it out
of all likeness of the simple truth. Hearing it
not, however, it is omitted from their pages.
You have, therefore, but my word for it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sitting now in a straight-backed arm-chair
he thoughtfully surveyed an image of Our
Lady on an oak bracket opposite to him, lending
ear the while to the Abbess’s discourse. A
brief discourse truly. It was not her way to
use two words where one sufficed, to elaborate
unnecessarily. Clear-brained herself she
looked for a like clarity in those with whom
she conversed. Finding it frequently absent
she prayed for patience. On this occasion no
such prayer was needed.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her discourse ended she fell to silence.
Having said her say she left the verdict to
other lips. An upright old figure, hands
hidden in the sleeves of her gown, she sat
waiting.</p>

<p class='c011'>To another than the Abbess it might have
appeared that her discourse had fallen on deaf
ears, or at the least on ears for the moment
closed to external sounds, since no reply followed
on her words. You might have said,
watching the Cardinal’s face, that his wits had
gone a-wool-gathering. Not so the Abbess.
Perfectly serene she awaited the response she
knew would come. Quiet reigned throughout
the place; within the room entire, without
broken only by an occasional footfall in the
passage, by the faint jingle of beads as they
swayed at the waist of some passing nun, or
the liquid note of pigeons from the roof of the
Minster.</p>

<p class='c011'>Presently the Cardinal roused himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, well,” he said smiling, “send the
child to me.”</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>Brigid entering anon saw a small tired-looking
old man sitting in a chair, his face
towards the window. On her entrance he
turned, and she saw no fatigue in the blue
eyes. Kneeling she kissed his hand. He
murmured words of blessing. Then—</p>

<p class='c011'>“Be seated, child,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>He shifted his position, looked more directly
at her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So thou hast left the Lady Isabel?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aye, my Lord.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And for what reason?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir, she desired my services no longer.”
Here was the same reply she had given to her
aunt the Abbess.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Cardinal put his hand up to his chin,
looked at her very shrewdly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And perchance thou no longer desirest
to serve her?” Here was a bow drawn at a
venture, but the shaft shot very near the
mark.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My Lord—” stammered Brigid reddening.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Suppose I hear the tale, my child.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is not wholly mine, my Lord.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Cardinal smiled. “Well, we will leave
it. The matter to my seeing stands thus.
Thou hast displeased her, and thou art not
wholly pleased with her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My Lord, I am very ill-pleased with her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He laughed. “At least thou art candid,
child. Now tell me truly, was there aught
of pique in thy leaving the Castle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“None, my Lord.” The reply was ready
enough. “I saw that she would not have me
see, I heard that she would not have me hear.
For that she liked me not, nor truly did I like
her. I can no longer give her my service
whole-heartedly, nor does she desire what
lesser service I might give her. Therefore am
I here.” Again the reply she had given the
Abbess, yet this time going further.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!” The fragile old hand beat lightly
on the arm of the chair. “And here thou
desirest to be a nun.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is my desire.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A sudden desire, child.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir,” said Brigid very low and earnest,
“may not Our Lord speak suddenly an’ He
will?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very true,” replied the Cardinal, “an’ it
be indeed His voice and not thy own heart
speaking.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Brigid remained silent. The Cardinal bent
kindly eyes towards her, read clearly resolve
in the small square face. Musing, he shifted
ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nuns pray much,” he said warningly.
“Thy aunt hath told me that on former occasions
when thou hast visited the Minster
prayer was none so greatly to thy liking.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mayhap, my Lord,” said Brigid sweetly,
“I can acquire liking. Here is a good school.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Cardinal’s eyes twinkled. Memory
turning backward many years he saw the Lady
Abbess herself before him, heard spoken words.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Methinks, daughter,” here was memory
speaking, “thou lackest meekness, a quality
possessed by nuns.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, Father, it were well I seek it where
it dwells so willingly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here he found a repetition of that little
scene.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am also told, child,” he continued,
banishing memory for the moment, testing
her replies, “that thou art over-merry. Nuns
are sober-minded.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Methinks, my Lord,” quoth Brigid demurely,
“that devotion on one note alone
may prove a very monotonous chant.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Again the Cardinal’s eyes twinkled. He
liked the spirit that could find quick reply,
fancied he saw here material other than usual
for Sister Gabrielle the Novice Mistress, for
all that saw her fashioning it willingly and
to good purpose. Matters were not, however,
wholly to his mind. Well-versed in dealing
with mankind the girl’s resolve was very
patent to him. He would learn further what
had brought the resolve to light.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Child,” he said on a sudden very grave,
“thou hast told me little that is in thy mind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Brigid looked towards the window. “My
Lord,” she said very low, “I lack words.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Find those thou canst,” he said kindly.
“Perchance I may aid thee further.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Brigid trembled. “Sir, I have seen a soul
in jeopardy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have seen many, child. What then?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, sir,” said Brigid, her voice thrilling,
“thinking on the one soul I thought on others.
I saw a warring world, Powers in deadly conflict,
Christ nailed to the Cross watching with
Patient Eyes. Sir, I would aid.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And how, child?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis that I ask you, my Lord. Methought
of ways and means, and found none. Then
methought me of prayer. Sir, I am a woman,
I can do but little. At the Foot of the Cross
from whence Christ reigns can I not pray
with Him in His Silence, in His Desire for the
souls of men? My Lord, I have no words to
show my meaning. Can you understand?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Cardinal looked not at her, but at the
figure of the Mother of God. “I understand
very well. Thou hast found words enough.
And is that all?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“All for which I can find the words, my
Lord.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Cardinal leaned back slowly in his chair.
On the wall opposite him the sunlight lay in a
brilliant patch creeping slowly upwards toward
the blue-robed figure on the oak bracket. A
silence endured a little space, a silence very
pregnant with unuttered thoughts. Anon he
roused himself, spoke almost briskly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well, child, thou knowest Our Lord demands
service in general from all souls, in
particular from some. It would seem possible
that He hath asked of thee an especial token
of thy love towards Him. Whether it is precisely
what those dost believe it to be cannot
be decided on the instant. Yet for my
part I see no hindrance—since thou hast no
earthly ties to bind thee—to our putting the
question to the test. Your part will be a
very detailed obedience.” He looked at her
very kindly as she knelt to kiss his hand. On
her departure he fell again into reverie.</p>

<p class='c011'>Later he spoke to the Lady Abbess.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Finding a certain likeness in the girl,”
quoth he with his shrewd old smile, “methinks
we may fashion as very excellent a nun from
the niece as the aunt hath proved herself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Truly, my Lord,” retorted the old lady,
“with my aid to the balance in the matter I
trust you will fashion a better one.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch09' class='c006'>CHAPTER IX<br /> <br />THE CASTING OF THE NET</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_5_0_65 c010'>LOYALTY holding Brigid silent concerning
certain matters between her and the
Lady Isabel, we, owing none, may well probe
somewhat further, though doubtless the manner
of the happening is already patent to
you.</p>

<p class='c011'>Isabel had found discovery exceeding unpleasant
to her mind. A hidden good disclosed
may irk men somewhat, a hidden evil
disclosed will irk them very surely. Isabel
brooked it not at all. Anger possessed her
soul. Hereafter she would ever see reproach
in the girl’s eyes, read condemnation in her
very silence. So unpleasant a state of things
was assuredly not to be suffered. Nor was
it discovery alone that displeased her. Conscience
pricking tardily showed her that
night’s work as very ill. Compunction in a
manner was present with her, yet no true
sorrow. Desirous of forgetting it she was
willing to profit by what knowledge it had
brought her. Yet forgetfulness were impossible
with Brigid’s eyes to remind her of it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Her spirit rebelled at the thought. She
would have all men see in her the perfection
she desired them to perceive. An’ she could
not lull Brigid’s mind to a like forgetfulness,
wake once more in her the full homage she
believed ever to have received of her, she
desired her presence no longer. There was
the matter very plainly. It lay wholly between
her and the girl. The warfare—for
such after a manner it became—had place in
private. It was of brief duration. To outward
seeming Isabel was the victor, yet to my
thinking it was Brigid who had triumphed,
since never for an instant had Isabel’s will
gained the mastery over hers.</p>

<p class='c011'>A faint whisper of evil, very subtly set
afloat, caused the court to look askance at
her. Some few cried, “I cannot believe it,”
yet rather in false piety than as true statement
of disbelief. Certainly the evil remained unproven,
since none sought to prove it, caring
little in the matter. As for Brigid, the whisper
was too faint to gain her ears. Later it grew
somewhat louder, when she was beyond its
reach. Then it was left to Mary Chester to
defend her, which she did right royally.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the small hours of the morning Brigid
rode away, the sun not far above the horizon,
the dew yet heavy on the grass. Pippo, his
arms full of flowers he had culled for her from
the garden, was at the postern gate to watch
her depart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“God keep you,” he said as she took his
flower burden from him. Peregrine using the
salutation at times he now used it himself,
though shyly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“God keep you too, Pippo,” she said,
smiling her thanks for his gift.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anon, turning in her saddle, she waved her
hand to him. Mary Chester’s friendship,
and Pippo’s bright face were her pleasantest
memories of the life she was leaving. Here,
too, were the child’s flowers in her arms. Thus
she rode away to Sangdieu, as we have seen.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>Isabel rejoiced at her departure, felt herself
free for the matter she had in hand. Throwing
aside all thought of a certain night that
June, she yet retained in part the memory of
the words then given her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That which thou dost desire is above thee.
Yet must thou stoop to attain it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>On the further speech she did not care to
dwell. This utterance sufficed her. Quick-witted,
she saw very clearly the significance
therein. It behooved her merely to act upon
it. Here was a delicate matter, requiring
careful handling. She had no mind to see
herself caught in the meshes she would spread
for another, a thing just possible to her
shrewd thinking. She must throw the light
cords deftly, that no breath of fancy should
recoil them on herself. This, for all the
seeming poetry of the task, would require
an exceeding level head, a cool and very
calculating judgment.</p>

<p class='c011'>With care she conned the part she saw herself
about to play, marked her entrance with
the meshes, made very sure of her exits.
Having it to her mind at her finger tips she
waited for Chance to set the stage.</p>

<p class='c011'>To leave matters to Chance is at times to
leave matters half way to the Devil. An’ he
is so minded he will come the other half to
meet them. Verily to my thinking he did
so now, took them in hand and arranged
them with age-old skill, exceeding simply.
And to this purpose he used a garden for his
first setting.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>Isabel walking in the garden one morning
of soft air and sunshine saw Peregrine by
the sundial. A favourite position this for our
Jester.</p>

<p class='c011'>Seating herself on the stone balustrade of
the terrace she raised her hand, beckoned him
to her. He came, stood before her, his eyes
alight like a child’s who has been called by a
close friend.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am weary,” she said softly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Truly, Madam!” quoth Peregrine very
astonished. Here was no day for weariness.
Sun-kissed, splendid in light and colour, the
earth breathed vitality and joy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of my own company,” said Isabel, smiling
at his look.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam,” stammered Peregrine, “I will
fetch your women to you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She laughed outright very musically. “That
is like to a man,” she said. “An’ they were
here I were none the less weary.” She
fetched a little sigh.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam,” said Peregrine troubled.</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked across the moorland, sadness
in her eyes. “Aye,” she said on a faint note
of bitterness, “soul-weary.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam,” said Peregrine for the third
time, any word but the one hard to find.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Methinks,” she said very low, “that the
loneliness of a woman seemingly surrounded
by many friends is a very bitter loneliness.
She looks for understanding and finds it not.
Those she has counted as truest to her may
ofttimes play her false, revile her, and leave
her. Yet to revile in turn were ill done. She
must smile when her heart is sore; laugh when
her spirit is bruised and bleeding, lest
she bring sadness into other lives.” She
stopped.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam,” said Peregrine very earnestly,
anger towards Brigid in his soul, “there is
at least one heart would suffer death gladly
for your sake.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah,” she smiled sadly, “at times I have
dreamed so. Yet where can I put trust? They
offer me homage with their lips yet none with
their hearts. Outwardly they speak me fair,
inwardly they see me shallow. Do you think
me shallow, Peregrine?” Here was a note
of pleading as from a child.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Never,” said Peregrine hotly.</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked at him very strangely. “An’
you speak so with your heart in your voice it
tempts me to believe you. You are Jester,
Peregrine; yet methinks the fool’s motley but
hides the heart of a loyal man. Is it so,
Peregrine?” She lingered on the name.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam,” said Peregrine, the heart in
question beating very hotly, “it beats in your
service alone.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You, too, are lonely?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam, it was so at one time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Since you have shown me favour, since
you have deigned to see the man beneath
the motley, my heart has been too full for
loneliness.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think,” she said softly, musing, “we
understand each other very well. It is
strange, is it not, it should be so? I, Isabel
de Belisle, and you a Jester, the meanest of
my household, so men would say, and we
hold a bond of understanding between us.
Let us not heed what men would say. I have
told you they see me very shallow. ’Tis
sweet to me to think you believe it not.
Shall we keep our understanding a secret
between us,” she held out her hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>Dropping on one knee he kissed it very
humbly. Had she demanded his soul from
him at that instant he had given it, believing
it were better in her keeping than in his own.
Perchance she had spoken again, but Mary
Chester came softly across the grass, saw the
two with eyes faintly troubled.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>Hereafter there were days of sweet glamour
for Peregrine. That he was understood he
had guessed before in part, as we have seen.
Here now were the words from his lady’s very
lips. Of all those who did her service none
knew her as he knew her, none saw the depths
beneath the sparkling surface, none saw the
heart-loneliness beneath the radiant smile.</p>

<p class='c011'>Days followed on days, outwardly the
same, yet holding many an exchange of
glances, many a tender half-uttered sigh, now
and again an unwatched meeting. There
were hours in her chamber when he sang to
her among her women, each word holding a
meaning known to the two alone; hours in the
garden in the full radiance of sun and colour,
when every bird that sang, when every flower
that bloomed poured benediction on them;
and—quintessence of joy—rare solitary meetings,
when heart spoke freely to heart in low
tender words. Small wonder he forgot all
else in the thought of her. Even Pippo’s
artless companionship became at times burdensome
to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>So she lured him on, saw the white flame of
his adoration turn to red with the fuel of her
giving. And softly day by day she threw
closer meshes round his soul. Unsuspecting,
it struggled not at all, made no attempt to
escape.</p>

<p class='c011'>Isabel smiled. The Devil, who had set the
stage, I am very sure laughed. At Sangdieu
Brigid prayed.</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>FOOL You cry in your heart, and perchance
again, Fool! Yet for my part
I find his folly in a manner to my liking. I
had liefer see a man prodigal of his gifts,
though he bestow them on an unworthy object,
than see him a niggard, grudging in his
giving.</p>

<p class='c011'>But, an’ you would know him truly, he
saw not himself as giving, believed not that
he bestowed gifts, believed himself merely
the recipient of them. Wherein the wrong
lay verily was that he forgot the Creator in the
created. This you will have doubtless guessed
already; it needs not that I show it you.</p>

<p class='c011'>An’ you call to mind the prophecy of the
old sage, who read the message of the stars
at his birth, you will remember his foretelling;
see Peregrine here the recipient of
favours from one of high birth, will look to
their withering like June roses when picked.
Now to the manner of their withering.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>It will be found in the chronicles of the
Lords of Belisle that in a certain year of Grace,
on the Feast of St. Mary Magdalene, one
Count Bonaventure de Novello came to the
Castle, bearing letters from Lord Robert to
his daughter Isabel. It is further shown that
he was received with hospitality, and remained
for a time as a favoured guest of the Castle.
The manner of his departure is not so clearly
given, but one may guess that he departed
in somewhat lesser favour. Yet it is neither
his departure nor the manner of it that concerns
us chiefly, but rather his arrival and his
sojourn.</p>

<p class='c011'>A comely man this Bonaventure de Novello,
so I have heard; of average height, olive-skinned,
and bright-eyed. He could dance,
he could sing; he had moreover a very pretty
wit, and a tongue that knew well the handling
of it. Up to a point it stood him in better
stead than rapier, since the tongue may
madden more readily than steel; the point
passed the rapier was not lacking in its skill.
In the matter of love he made it not at all,
since he got plenty without his making, and
scorned it accordingly. It was the same, I
take it, with homage, liking, or any other
favour. Therefore you will see Isabel looking
queerly on him at the first, since it was ever
her way to receive willingly rather than to
give. Anon she began to exercise her customary
wiles over him. Finding him none
too easy to lure the task absorbed her. We
may see Peregrine forgotten. Here it was
that his roses began to wither.</p>

<p class='c011'>It is no easy task to show you Peregrine at
this time. Very silent, showing his mind to
none, one can but guess at it. I fancy he
saw at first in Isabel’s bearing but the natural
extra courtesy to a new-comer, a guest.
Found—before a stranger—her apparent indifference
towards himself to be expected.
For a time he suffered it gladly, seeing himself
thereby enduring a trifle of hardship for
her sake, and at her will. Anon perplexity
dawned upon his soul. A dog look crept into
his eyes, the wonder of a dumb animal who
believes he has displeased, yet knows not the
manner of the displeasing; who holds none the
less utter faith in his master. A word, a look
at this time would have restored full buoyancy
to his heart. None came, therefore he
suffered mutely.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Truly you possess a very merry Jester,”
quoth the Count one day, light sarcasm in the
words.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A dull fellow,” said Isabel idly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He eyes you like a dog at one time fondled,
now relegated to the courtyard,” laughed
Bonaventure. Easily uttered, spoken wholly
in jest, the words shot very straight to Isabel’s
heart, dyed her face with faint colour.</p>

<p class='c011'>“An’ his sire had not been Jester before
him, I would have none of him,” she answered
a thought over-readily. “Custom gave him
the cap and bells which he wears, as you perceive,
with a very long face.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bonaventure laughed again. “An’ but
custom gave him the motley, methinks I
would override custom,” he responded. And
thereupon turned to other matters.</p>

<p class='c011'>His words, however, remained with Isabel.
Plainly, she was weary of the Jester. Body
and soul she saw him hers; there was no
longer aught to gain. Also she misliked very
heartily the dumb pleading of his eyes.
Weariness turned to impatience, impatience
to something akin to anger. What right had
he to stir compunction in her? Her favours
were her own to give or withhold at will.
Given, they must be received with gratitude;
withheld, there must be no whining. Yet
Peregrine had never whined; he had, however,
looked with the eyes of a dumb dog.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sitting in her chamber she brooded somewhat
sullenly on the matter. After some
space a thought came to her, gradually crystallizing.
Bonaventure might perchance aid
her in dealing with the affair. Here she
calculated briefly, lightly. It would entail
a slight wandering from the truth. What
then? Truth it happened was of less consideration
to her than ease of mind. From
the one thought she turned to others. They
followed each other quickly. Purposing to
wrong the Jester, hatred followed swiftly in
its train. There is ever but a step between
the two. Her revolution of feeling towards
him being sudden was proportionately strong.
It brought ice to her heart, not heat. This
is the more dangerous, since with it there
is no surcharging of the brain to unbalance
thought. Briefly, she would say to Bonaventure,
“Rid me of this man,” yet employ
not those words at all. Her request simply
put in other fashion it would remain to see
if he accepted it with a like simplicity, if a
dealing that smacks very surely of meanness
may be termed simple.</p>

<p class='c011'>Being alone with the Count she spoke to
him very levelly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A while ago you mentioned our long-faced
Jester.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Truly, Madam, I did,” replied Bonaventure,
“yet have small desire to mention
him again. I had as lief dwell on an east
wind blight.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Isabel smiled, then sighed. “An’ my
father had not given him the post I would
have none of him. In his absence I like not
to oust his servants.” A very dutiful daughter,
she sighed more deeply.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You would an’ you could?” he queried.</p>

<p class='c011'>“He hath done no ill,” said Isabel musing.
“’Tis wrong of me thus to mislike him, and
foolish truly, since why should I concern myself
with the fellow at all? Yet ’tis, as you
say, the east wind blight that causes me to
shiver.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bonaventure smiled. Truly the transparency
of her desire was very patent. An’
he would he saw himself giving aid in the
matter. Considering a brief space he decided
to take it in hand, this rather from light mischief
than any ill-will towards Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Truly, as you say,” said he solemn-faced,
“the fellow has done no ill. ’Twere unjust
to hold him to account for a long visage and
a hang-dog look. He is also a peaceable man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very peaceable,” averred Isabel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then ’tis evident he must bide here, since
’tis your father’s pleasure.” He looked not
at Isabel as he spoke; but she, glancing side-ways
at his face, was by no means so ill-satisfied
at what she saw there. Matters to
her mind were put in train.</p>

<p class='c011'>Feeling them so, pity brought a slight thaw
to hatred. Once she smiled on the Jester,
gave her hand to be kissed on the conclusion
of a song that pleased her. Light tokens
truly, yet hope springing swift anew to Peregrine’s
heart the subsequent happenings were
the more bitter.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>One morning Isabel sitting in her chamber
heard voices below her window. The words
themselves reached her not, yet the tone was
apparent to her. There was the Count’s
smooth, exceeding silky; Peregrine’s holding
exasperation for the moment well
controlled.</p>

<p class='c011'>Seemingly unheeding she yet listened intently.
Mary Chester raised anxious eyes
from her embroidery; Leonora calm as her
mistress, worked steadily; Monica, paling,
fingered her rosary.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anon the Count laughed. Light though
the sound was it held a stinging note. Peregrine’s
voice rose somewhat harder.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam,” breathed Mary very low some
unnamed fear clutching at her heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>Isabel looked towards her. “Yes?” she
queried, eyebrows raised.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis naught,” stammered Mary reddening,
words halting on her tongue.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah!” The exclamation came from without.
Though holding pain, Mary detected
triumph in the sound. She moved very
swiftly to the window.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam!” she said again in horror.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is it?” asked Isabel quickly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The Count Bonaventure lies upon the
ground,” stammered Mary. “Methinks that
Peregrine—” she broke off trembling.</p>

<p class='c011'>Isabel joined her at the window.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Go below, see to what hath chanced,”
she ordered. And to herself she added, “I
pray Count Bonaventure hath not over-reached
himself in the matter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Ill news flies very swiftly. Within the space
of five minutes the whole Castle was agog
with the happening. Peregrine the Jester
had stabbed Count Bonaventure. True the
wound was not over-serious, yet that was
rather by good fortune than by good intention.
Some half hour later Peregrine lay in
the cellar; the Count, his wound bound, made
light of the matter.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I can take it none so easily,” said Isabel
hard-eyed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The fellow should be hanged,” said Roger
March, the captain of the guard, very
bluntly. These were rude times, and Roger
a hard-headed soldier.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bah!” laughed Bonaventure ruefully,
“’tis no matter for so harsh dealing.” Already
he half-regretted his part in the affair.
He liked Peregrine for his onslaught; saw the
tongue a mean weapon to have used for his
provoking.</p>

<p class='c011'>Isabel’s eyes narrowed. “I cannot overlook
it,” she repeated very cold, seeing opportunity
slipping from her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shall he hang, Madam?” asked Roger
briefly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“By the Lord, no,” burst forth the Count.
“You will not have a woman give orders to
hang a man. An’ he deserve punishment
give him a drubbing and dismiss him the
Castle. So shall all be satisfied,” he added
half maliciously.</p>

<p class='c011'>Roger looked at Isabel, awaited her pleasure.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have heard the Count’s words,” said
Isabel very icily. “The injured may assign
his own reward for the injury. I leave the
affair.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Roger March saluted and withdrew.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Count, by the window, drummed
lightly on the sill with his fingers, looked not
at Isabel standing rigid by the hearth. The
mental atmosphere held an unpleasant chill.</p>

<p class='c011'>Sudden sounds broke the silence; trampling
of feet on the stairway, exclamations of anger.</p>

<p class='c011'>Isabel and the Count faced about towards
the door. The heavy draperies of the curtain
swung aside. Peregrine burst into the room,
fell on his knees before Isabel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam,” he cried thickly, imploring,
“I come to crave pardon. Allot me what
punishment you will, but dismiss me not
from your presence.” The words were out
of his lips ere the captain of the guard and
two of his men had gained the chamber.
Beyond the swaying curtain was a group of
women with scared faces.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Count looked at the kneeling figure;
the somewhat cynical smile on his lips was
not for it. From the Jester he glanced at
Isabel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Take the fellow away,” said Isabel.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the sound of her voice Peregrine looked
up at her face. Realization dawned on him.
He got to his feet, staggering like a man dazed
with over-much wine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Your will, Madam?” said Roger sternly.
He trusted now to find his hands busy with
the rope.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have given you my orders already,”
said Isabel harshly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Roger March, grim-faced, led Peregrine
away.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Count looked at Isabel. Meeting her
eyes very full he smiled mockingly.</p>

  <h2 id='ch11' class='c006'>CHAPTER XI<br /> <br />OUTCASTE</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>THUS a second time we see Peregrine dismissed
the Castle.</p>

<p class='c011'>Exceeding sore in body, yet infinitely more
sore in mind, he lay in a wood some two
miles or so from the spot where the last blow
had fallen upon him. Half fainting he had
dragged himself thither. Roger March had
been in no mind to see light punishment dealt
out.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a time a sort of stupor fell on him,
dulling in part the pain of body and soul.
A sick man half delirious he felt himself,
tortured by very evil dreams. Mocking faces
surrounded him, and in their midst one face
very cold, looking at him with eyes full of
scorn and hatred. Then, for a while, the
lapse of years escaping him, he believed
himself a child burying a hot face in his
mother’s gown, weeping out his woes in her
lap. Later he found the lap to be that of
Mother Earth, her gown the cool green of
the moss against his cheek. Turning his head
he saw the green-leaved branches above him,
had a glimpse of summer blue sky. This
brought him back to the present. He sat up
feeling the swelled stiffness of his back and
limbs.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some hundred yards or so before him his
eye caught the glint of water among the
trees. He remembered that he was very
thirsty. He rose stiffly to his feet, made his
way towards the pond. It lay clear as a
mirror, reflecting the trees.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine, kneeling at the margin, bent towards
it, saw a haggard-faced Jester looking
up at him. For a moment startled by his
own reflection he drew back; then laughed.
Hard-eyed he looked at his own image; on
a sudden saw himself Jester to Fate. Here
was his rôle with a vengeance. He looked
at his own face again, and with new interest,
grinned at it a moment very diabolically.
The next, he dashed his fist in the water. The
reflection shivered to a thousand sparkling
fragments.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To Fate’s Jester,” he cried. And he
drank thirstily from his cupped hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>A crackling in the woods behind him brought
him to his feet. His frayed nerves tensioned
he gazed towards the bushes. From among
them came a small figure in blue and silver,
glancing anxious-eyed to right and left. Seeing
Peregrine the boy rushed forward, flung himself
before him, clasped his knees.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Peregrine, Peregrine,” he sobbed. “Oh!
the brutes. Would I were a man!”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine hauled the child gently to his feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tut, lad,” he said lightly, “’tis all in the
day’s work.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The boy snivelled in his sleeve. His
cheeks were very tear-glazed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“An’ thou wert the man thou desirest to
be thou wouldst not weep,” said Peregrine
seating himself on the ground, drawing the
child beside him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My heart would,” choked the boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine finding grim truth in the reply
made no answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I hate them all,” said Pippo, his young
face very vicious. At that Peregrine laughed
mirthlessly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will not return to the Castle,” said the
boy stubbornly, “I will come with you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine fell grave on the instant. He
saw not a child travelling by the road he was
like to follow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nay,” he responded firmly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must,” choked Pippo.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thou wilt return to the Castle,” said
Peregrine very levelly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why?” demanded Pippo.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine smiled. “Firstly, not being my
property I cannot carry thee away with me;
secondly, my road is not like to be one for a
child; thirdly, I wish thee to return, Pippo.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Pippo’s mouth trembled. “For thirdly
I will do your bidding,” he said in a very
small voice. “I would not for firstly nor
secondly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good lad,” said Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>For some moments there was silence.
Pippo’s face was quivering; Peregrine’s very
set and stern.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So, boy, it is farewell,” he quoth anon.
Pippo found his voice too shaky for
speech.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine got to his feet, the lad with him.
“I will take thee to the edge of the wood,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c011'>In silence they made their way among the
trees. In some ten minutes they found
themselves on their outskirts. Here Peregrine
paused.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Farewell, lad,” he said. “Put not your
trust in princes, as the Psalmist hath it.
Pray to Christ and Our Lady, and live clean.”
Smiling grimly at the words himself he had to
give them to the lad. A child’s faith must be
left unshaken. Peregrine having this thought
in mind doubtless the Recording Angel made
tally of the speech to his balance.</p>

<p class='c011'>He kissed the boy twice, and without more
ado turned back among the trees, mistrusting
himself for further words. Pippo went
sorrowfully enough down the hill.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>Peregrine struck again clean through the
wood. The Castle thus lay behind him, and
the greater distance he might put between
himself and it the better now would he be
pleased.</p>

<p class='c011'>He made his way along the soft path, cool
green for the most part, here and there
scattered with dancing spots of gold as the
sunlight filtered through the branches overhead.
On either hand were tree trunks,
straight as the pillars of some cathedral,
flecked with the orange and silver of fungus
and lichen, very brilliant patches of colour.
It was a silent place, quiet and restful. Formerly
Peregrine’s spirit had gone out to meet
the spirit of the woods, to find pleasure in the
meeting. Now he found none. Disillusionment
pressing sore upon him crushed his soul
very bitterly.</p>

<p class='c011'>At last, after some time of walking, he came
upon the edge of the wood. Here it was
bordered by the high road, very white and
dusty, the sun’s rays beating full upon it. To
the right it ascended somewhat, to the left
it sloped in a gentle decline. Peregrine hesitated.
He had no goal in view, nor sought to
have any.</p>

<p class='c011'>While hesitating he became aware of a
party of three horsemen riding at a trot from
the leftwards. He drew into the shadow of the
trees to await their passing. Coming abreast
of them he saw in the foremost the Count
Bonaventure, the other two being serving
men. The Count wore his left arm in a
sling, a matter that Peregrine marked with
no little satisfaction. Allowing them to pass
some couple of hundred yards or so, he stepped
from the wood, turned down the hill. He
had made but a few paces when the sound of
a horse’s hoofs behind him struck on his ear.
He stepped quickly towards the hedge. The
horse and its rider pulled up along side of
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I saw you among the trees,” said Bonaventure
without preamble.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What then?” demanded Peregrine, the
pupils of his eyes narrowing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Merely,” quoth the Count lightly, “that
I wish to make you an apology.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No need,” said Peregrine shortly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yet I did you an injury.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Methinks I did you one,” said Peregrine,
looking at the bound arm.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis one will mend,” was the reply.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine was silent.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yet, perchance,” said the Count musing,
“the injury I did you was not so great as at
first sight might appear.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I find it a benefit,” said Peregrine very
dryly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“An’ a man pitch his tent on a vile bog
believing it fair earth ’twere a benefit to drag
him from it, even though the handling be
somewhat rough.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh!” said the Count amazed, opening his
eyes wide, “you have seen that.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have seen more than that,” said Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes?” queried the Count.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have seen that you,” said Peregrine
watching him, “acted as subtly prompted, if
not fairly told.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Count stroked his chin, half whimsical,
half vexed. He was not wholly pleased to be
named a tool in the matter, which he truly was.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I think you have seen a good deal,”
quoth he ruefully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Disillusionment clears a man’s eyesight,”
said Peregrine shortly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Humph!” remarked the Count. “Where
fare you now?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine shrugged his shoulders. “Where
Chance leads. Mayhap to the Devil.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“An unpleasant fellow,” said the Count
suavely, “and moreover no gentleman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Truly!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A very usurer. Getting a man in his
debt he demands constant interest, exceeding
extortionate.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“An’ a man were wise he would return
the whole loan and have done with the
matter,” returned Peregrine carelessly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No man has sufficient capital for that
when he once takes loan from the Devil,”
replied the Count half grimly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You seem to have a very good knowledge
of his dealings,” said Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>Bonaventure shrugged his shoulders. “I
have observed them more than once,” he
said coolly. “An’ you have no better prospect
in view than perchance to serve him,
will you join company with me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine shook his head. “No,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am barely surprised,” returned the
Count. “Yet I would ask you, unaccountable
as it may seem to you, to come as my friend,
not as my servant.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine laughed. “I put no trust in
friends.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That also does not surprise me,” said
Bonaventure. “I put not vast trust neither,
but take men as I find them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you will not find much,” retorted
Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not look for much.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That shows you wise.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Bonaventure laughed. “Wisdom is what
I seek. Perchance some day I shall find her.
However since you will not seek her in my
company I must e’en bid you farewell.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Farewell,” said Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We part on good terms?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In no enmity as far as I am concerned,”
said Peregrine carelessly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then again, farewell,” quoth the Count.
Turning his horse he rode quickly after his
men. Peregrine stood looking after him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch12' class='c006'>CHAPTER XII<br /> <br />THE WANDERER</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>WITHIN a certain forest was a Castle,
hidden tolerably deep within it. It
lay not many miles from the Castle of Belisle,
which stood upon an eminence. Though
hidden from it by the surrounding trees the
dwellers at Belisle knew of its existence. It
was named, so I have heard, Castle Syrtes.
It had a somewhat unwholesome reputation;
it has also been termed magical in an evil
manner.</p>

<p class='c011'>You came upon it by tortuous paths through
the forest, the outskirts of which were slushy
and boggy to the feet. Having passed the
outskirts you could find paths in plenty. Despite
their tortuous winding they led eventually
to the Castle. Outwardly pleasing to
the eye, built of a reddish stone brought
from no man knew where, the interior pleased
the senses no less. Here were marble halls,
shaded bowers, silken curtains, pictures very
subtly painted, rare curios brought from
home and lands beyond the seas. Flowers
within and without, many-coloured and full-perfumed,
lent a sweet and somewhat heavy
scent to the atmosphere. It was never wind-lifted.
The winds, which at times blew
freely on the outskirts of the forest, brought
no cleansing breath to the interior. Perchance
the trees grew too thickly to allow
of it passing between their branches; perchance
there was some deeper reason. For
that you may make what judgment you
choose. My part is to set forth facts as I
know them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Within the Castle dwelt a woman named
Thaïs. To my thinking she had been better
named Venus or Aphrodite. Failing either
of those names Thaïs suits her not ill-well.
She did not dwell alone; solitude would have
been by no means to her liking. Guests she
had in plenty, and they fared very luxuriously
at her hands. The days were passed in feasting
and pleasure; song, music, and wine lent
good aid thereto. In brief the existence was
one of exceeding soft luxury.</p>

<p class='c011'>At times a guest wearied of the pastimes,
found them over sweet to his taste. Such a
one was known now and again to leave the
Castle; but I have heard it given as fact, which
fact may be noteworthy, that he found the
return through the forest more wearisome than
the approach. Thorns and brambles, which
stood aside to let him pass on entrance,
hedged his path sadly on departure. Perchance
herein lay its reputation for evil-magic.
Certain it is the forest was strange,
very dark, and full of a sweet sickly odour.
No fresh-scented flowers grew there, such as
one may find in open meadows and cool
breeze-swept woods, but curious orchids,
spotted and twisted, reptile-like in colour and
form. Also no song-birds penetrated to its
depths, misliking the darkness.</p>

<p class='c011'>What brought Peregrine thither I know not,
seeing he had at the first wandered many a
day’s march from Belisle. Possibly he circled
thereto unheeding his route, knowing not he
was returning on his own traces.</p>

<p class='c011'>Be that as it may, one evening at sundown
he saw the forest facing him. It lay a dark
patch on the horizon, backed by torn clouds
through which the sunset sky showed red and
lurid. Around him was the pathless earth,
rough and very desolate. No sign of human
habitation was in sight. Rocky boulders
flung up here and there among the coarse-grassed
earth loomed with uncouth shapes
in the waning light. To his thinking they
seemed cast there by some mighty spirit in
grim play; one, who, wearying of the game,
had withdrawn to some distant region, the
loneliness now emphasized by his one-time
presence there.</p>

<p class='c011'>Behind the forest the torn clouds began
piecing together in a heaped ominous mass,
the red light obliterated. The heavy air,
exceeding sultry, bespoke storm. Far off, to
the right, he saw a white road climbing a hillside.
A bare tree, set where the top of the
hill touched the sky, flung a couple of branches
wide-spread from its trunk. Cross-like it
crowned the summit; leafless, dead, yet symbol
of the Tree of Life.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine looked towards the road. Doubtless
it led some whither. But where? There
was the question. Also it was far off and
very steep. A storm was brewing. Already
he could hear the low muttering of thunder.
To gain yonder road and seek some distant
shelter along it would entail a very thorough
drenching before any goal had been attained.
The forest was but a quarter the distance from
him. He might well seek harbourage there.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet, despite the thought, his eyes turned
again towards the distant road. An’ he were
sure of shelter beyond the summit of the climb
he might risk the storm which very certainly
would break upon him. For the space of some
moments he hesitated. Then common sense
won the day. The white road might lead
him but on some fool’s errand. Before him
lay obvious cover from the oncoming deluge.
He stepped out across the coarse grass, now
hastening his steps somewhat. Nearing the
forest the grass became shorter and smoother,
but here the bog began to show itself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I bargained not for this,” said Peregrine,
as his feet sank into the slush. Even as
he spoke heavy drops began to fall; thunder
muttered very ominously. A third time he
glanced towards the distant road.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bah!” he said, “’tis too far off. A sharp
transit, and shelter will be gained.” He
made quick strides forward. The atmosphere,
which had been windless, was suddenly
rent by a heavy blast. “Now it comes,”
said Peregrine, as the storm beat upon him,
and the rain sluiced down on the sodden earth.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A very miry way,” muttered Peregrine
breathless as he gained the margin of the forest,
looked ruefully down at his feet. Turning,
he looked behind him. Where had been
spongey earth were now wide pools, stung by
falling rain, whipped by slashing wind. The
further landscape was blotted out by mist and
quick-gathering dusk.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A most villainous storm,” said Peregrine,
“and it is well I have found cover from it.
Here I must bide for a while at least. There
is no re-crossing that morass.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now he must think what to do. To sit
quiet where he was, and watch the rain were
dull and dismal work. For all that the forest
was very dark it might be well to explore
somewhat further. He turned down a winding
path. In spite of the first sense of darkness
he was now aware of a curious light
glimmering through the place. This came, he
saw, from some strange fungus on the trunks
of the trees, which gave forth an uncanny
illumination. It was faint truly, but sufficed
to show the path before him.</p>

<p class='c011'>As he walked, the odour of the forest struck
upon his nostrils, heavy, sickly-sweet. Passing
to his brain it dulled his senses somewhat,
like the odour of a powerful drug. He found
himself pursuing his way after the manner of
a man half-dreaming, heedless now of where
his path might lead. Half drowsed though
he was he noted now and again the orchids
that grew among the trees, saw their spotted
hue, their twisted reptile-like form. Despite
his drowsiness he felt some slight repulsion at
the sight of them, thought momentarily on
sun-kissed flowers in open meadows. By contrast
the orchids fared ill in his mind. But
sleep clutching at his eyelids made thought an
effort.</p>

<p class='c011'>He stumbled onward very heavily. How
long he walked he knew not. It might have
been an hour, two hours; yet, time perchance
being as leaden-footed as he, it might have
been a bare ten minutes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly, with no volition on his own part,
his brain swung from dulness, roused itself
to action; and strange action truly. It awakened,
it would seem, from stupor to fantastic
delirium. He felt himself vividly alive, and
utterly alone. Alone he was verily in that
forest devoid of living creatures. Yet the
loneliness was of spirit rather than of body.
In that moment his spirit was caught up into
space. Knowing the earth beneath him,
solid, material, around and above him were
vast distances, deep silences. In the furthest
distance, in the deepest silence, at so great an
altitude that his brain seeing it reeled, gleamed
a great star. Now here was the fuller fantasy.
Within the depth of his own soul he was
conscious of a like spot of light, a glowing
star, yet very tiny. And he knew that between
the star within him and the star above
him was a strange attraction.</p>

<p class='c011'>In space then his spirit hung, poised on
nothingness, so it seemed. And here he was
aware that he himself held his soul thus poised.
By will he could clutch at the earth beneath
him, draw himself down to it; by relinquishment
of will he could be drawn, by virtue of
the star within him, into the distance to the
other star, infinitely remote. Deep silence
lay around him, a hush as of expectation and
waiting. To him like a breath of wind from
far-off places came the words, “<i>Excelsus super
omnes gentes Dominus, et super cælus gloria
ejus</i>.” He knew now what it meant; saw in a
lightning flash where the choice lay. Yet the
vastness above him filled him with terror. A
strange cowardice seized upon him; a frantic
desire for the material, the solid. Madly his
will clutched at the earth beneath him....</p>

<p class='c011'>He found himself walking in the forest, the
stupor and the delirium alike passed. And
now he was very sure he had been dreaming.
Once more his brain was clear and steady.
He half mocked at himself for his brief
delusion.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some half-dozen paces further on the trees
thinned on a sudden. He came out upon a
smooth grass sward beyond which stood a
Castle, the light streaming from the windows.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch13' class='c006'>CHAPTER XIII<br /> <br />CASTLE SYRTES</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>TRULY I would have thought, and you
would have thought, and we might well
imagine Peregrine would have thought, he
had had enough of castles and the dwellers
therein. Yet there is no question but that
he welcomed very heartily its appearance
before him. Here at least was the tangible,
the solid, the very definitely material to
counteract the sudden and extraordinary isolation
of spirit which had fallen momentarily
upon him. He had told himself it was a
dream, a mere fantastic illusion of the brain
wrought of the strange atmosphere of the
forest; yet, for all that, the memory of the
illusion, if such it was, lingered faintly with
him, caused him to feel no little relief at the
sight of the Castle. Where there is a dwelling,
and moreover a lighted dwelling, there
are doubtless human beings, and their presence
would be of solace to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>He crossed the grass sward, his feet striking
noiselessly on the soft surface. Nearing the
windows he looked within. Here he saw
a large company seated at a well-furnished
board. Glass and silver sparkled on the table.
There were decanters full of red wine, dishes
piled with fruits, flowers purple, scarlet, and
orange. The guests themselves lent brilliance
and colour to the scene. Surrounded by a
living flower-wreath, so the board appeared;
wind-swayed, sun-kissed, as they moved in
talk and laughter, jewels on head, neck, and
arm glittering in the light.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the head of the board sat a woman in a
robe of orange silk. Her hair, a tawny gold,
bound with a fillet of flaming stones, shone
with its own lustre, rivalled successfully the
brilliance of her gown. Her skin, olive hued,
glowed with a very subtle warmth. You
guessed her body possessed of the fires of the
South. Her eyes, a purple-blue, looked at
you from beneath dark brows level and very
beautifully marked. Her mouth, curved and
modelled like a Greek mouth, squared faintly
at the corners, showing her luxurious. Her
nose, straight and finely chiselled, had delicately
arched nostrils. She leaned back in her
chair, a great one of carved ivory, and smiled
at the faces around her.</p>

<p class='c011'>One man sprang to his feet, a pretty youth
in purple doublet and hose, a big amethyst
hanging from a silver chain about his neck.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To Thaïs!” he cried, raising his glass on
high. The light shining through it the wine
glowed like a ruby.</p>

<p class='c011'>The flower-wreath about the table swayed,
rose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“To Thaïs!” came the cry from a score of
voices, while ruby-red glasses flashed aloft.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The glorious Thaïs!” cried one.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The divine Thaïs!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The adorable Thaïs!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The incomparable Thaïs!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thaïs the Enchantress!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thaïs our Venus!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thaïs our Aphrodite!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thaïs whom we worship!”</p>

<p class='c011'>So the litany went around the board.
And Peregrine without mocked in his heart,
deeming them fools, yet in a manner envying
them their folly.</p>

<p class='c011'>The cry died away. Again the guests were
seated at the table. Peregrine drew his
tabor from beneath his cloak, a long sombre
garment, given him by an old woman on the
third day of his journeying.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis not well to blazon yourself Jester,”
she had said sagely. “An’ men have the
sense to see you so beneath the cloak ’tis
other matter. A true Jester will hide his
motley. ’Tis your false fool shows his garb
to all comers. You, I think, are true Jester.”
Whereupon she had chuckled very cunningly.</p>

<p class='c011'>So Peregrine wore the cloak she had given
him, finding wisdom in her words. Now from
beneath it he pulled forth his tabor,
stepped into the shadow of the Castle,
touched the strings lightly and set himself to
sing.</p>

<p class='c014'>The song died away. A figure moved to the
window. Backed by brilliant light it made a
dark patch in the square opening.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who sings warningly of love?” demanded
a voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do,” said Peregrine through the darkness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And who are you, if one may be allowed
the question?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A wanderer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Truly one who has wandered to good purpose
since he finds himself at so fair a goal.
Wilt show yourself, Sir Wanderer?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine stepped into the square of light
cast upon the grass from the window. He
saw looking out at him a big man clad in
scarlet, somewhat full-bodied. His face, as
well as Peregrine could see it against the
light, was sufficiently humorous, with small
twinkling eyes deep-set.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What brought you hither?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fate an’ it please you,” returned Peregrine.
“Folly an’ it like you better.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Folly leads not on so good a path. We
will call it Fate.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“At your will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Or perchance it were better to term it good
sense.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good sense,” said Peregrine, “having
forethought in plenty gives the surplus of her
wares to those she takes in hand. By which
token I doubt me ’twas hers led me hither.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The big man laughed. “We’ll quarrel not
as to the guide. ’Tis good enough that you
are here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Humph!” said Peregrine, “maybe. But
now that I am here what comes next in
order?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That you enter the Castle.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A very friendly suggestion,” quoth Peregrine.
“I would however point out that I
bring no letter of credentials.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The big man laughed again, this time rather
queerly. “For that matter the fact that you
have found your way hither is in itself full
enough credential. We are not inhospitable.
Also I might suggest that you have no credential
from us.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine shrugged his shoulders. “’Twere
a pretty thing if a beggar should demand
credentials from the man who gave him alms,
or the wanderer from the man who offered him
a shelter. An’ he did so he were a fool might
well go drown in his own folly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And you would swim in your own wisdom,
so your words and song would show.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“If you judge by words you judge ill,”
said Peregrine dryly, “since no man will own
his words folly. It needs your wise man to
own himself a fool, and thereby show his
greater wisdom, since he but owns to the
heritage of his birth. And the man who
denies himself possessed of parents is a very
patent fool. But to cease quibbling and
come to fact. You see before you a hungry
man, a tired man, a foot-sore man. An’ your
hospitality be of deed rather than word I
prithee let me experience it on the instant.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“With all the will in the world,” said the
big man, and he turned from the window.</p>

<p class='c011'>The next instant the Castle door was flung
wide open. Light streamed blazing forth.
Peregrine stumbled towards it. Blinking he
found himself atop the steps, dazzled by the
greater brilliance.</p>

<p class='c011'>The man in scarlet caught him by the arm.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are spent,” he said kindly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It would seem so,” said Peregrine, laughing
ruefully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Drink this.” A glass of wine was held
to his lips.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine pushed it aside. “An’ I drink
wine on an empty stomach you will see a very
drunken man.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bah! ’tis not so potent.” Then as Peregrine
still pushed the glass aside, “’Tis our
custom, man. All who enter here drink a
toast to the Lady Thaïs on the doorstep, swear
her fealty in drinking.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You told me not of stipulations,” muttered
Peregrine very weary.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis but an ancient custom, man. There’s
no ill in the glass. Drink it, and cry to Thaïs.
’Twill put new strength into you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Thus urged Peregrine took the glass. “To
Thaïs!” he said, and sipped the wine. Very
sweet to the palate it ran warm down his
throat. “The divine Thaïs!” he cried laughing,
remembering the toast he had heard.
He drank the remainder at a draught, flung
the glass to the floor. “Ah!” he said. “It
puts new life in a man. Your name?” he
asked on a sudden of the other.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They call me Phrixus,” came the answer,
“since as a child I escaped from my stepmother,
a very sharp-tongued woman. Truly
’twas by the skin of my teeth I did so, and
on no golden-fleeced ram neither. Phrixus I
have been since, and still am. May I ask
a name for a name?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Peregrine, at your service. A fool as I
dare swear myself. A wanderer as you have
perceived.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A lucky wanderer,” quoth the other, and
took him by the arm. Very gently he propelled
him towards the great hall.</p>

<p class='c011'>Pausing a moment on the threshhold Peregrine
looked around. The hall was a riot of
colour, a very feast for the sight. A huge
place it was; the centre a great domed arch,
golden and set on four columns of black
marble. The walls were hung with tapestries
orange and yellow, bordered with blue and
purple most deftly intermingled. So remote
were the tapestries that the figures at the
table appeared backgrounded against sunlight
above deep waters. Around were marble
statues, works of the world in the morning of
time. Here was Hebe young and slender;
Mercury wing-footed; Atalanta poised swift
to run; Faunus half man half goat; Bacchus
vine-wreathed; Apollo, Athene, Venus,—all
were there wrought of voluptuous fancy. Here
and there gleamed silver nymphs and dryads,
flashing to seeming life in the red light of the
fire which blazed at the further end of the
great hall. Green marble made the floor,
spread with rugs an harmonious blend of
colour. Beneath the golden dome was set
the board, and here was movement, life, and
laughter.</p>

<p class='c011'>As Peregrine stood in the doorway with
Phrixus beside him, those opposite it looked
up and saw him, the others turned.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Welcome the new-comer!” The cry rang
through the hall, losing itself in echoes in the
golden dome. None could mistake the genuine
ring of it. Peregrine was led forward;
kneeling he kissed the hand Thaïs gave him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“We bid you welcome, Sir,” she said very
graciously. And she gave him a place on her
right.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you not lay aside your cloak?”
The request very delicately toned yet held a
faint air of command. Willy-nilly Peregrine
slipped it from his shoulders.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha!” laughed Phrixus, “you are Jester.
So I might have guessed. Truly being so
you are doubly welcome. Is it not so,
friends?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Again a cry rang loud. “Welcome the
Jester!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“An’ I were not very sure I were waking
I should hold myself dreaming,” mused
Peregrine inwardly. Fate to his mind played
pretty pranks with a man’s life, tossed it
shuttlecock-like from depths to heights,
threw it from fair earth to stony ground, and
then again to very flowery beds. Here at
least was one sufficiently pleasing for the
moment. Truly he would take no thought
for the morrow, but enjoy the hour to its
full. An honoured guest he sat there, satisfying
his appetite very fully from silver dishes
served to him by pages in white and
gold.</p>

<p class='c011'>The meal ended the board was cleared. It
and the trestles on which it lay were carried
away by serving men, rugs rolled aside. At
the end of the hall, somewhat near the great
fireplace, was a raised dais. Here the ivory
chair was placed. Thaïs seated in it the company
disposed themselves around her according
to will. Peregrine lay at her feet on
sapphire blue cushions soft as eiderdown.
Very content with the present he waited for
the next move.</p>

<p class='c011'>It came. The lights in the hall were extinguished.
The moonlight, falling through
the windows, lay along the floor in a silver
pathway. The tapestries at the further end
of the hall swung apart. From between
them, down the moonlight path, ran bare-footed
girls silken-robed, veiled, four phalanxes
of colour, pale heliotrope shading to
deepest purple; red to fullest crimson; the
green of young beech leaves to the black
green of pine trees; maize-colour toning
through orange to tawny brown. A moment
they swayed bowing before the dais, then set
themselves to dance, accompanied by music
from hidden musicians. Their feet upon the
green marble of the floor were like little white
flowers dancing in breeze-swept meadows.
Here was very intoxication of movement,
rhythm perfect in harmony. As they danced
they raised their veils. Peregrine looked on
their faces oval, bright-eyed, scarlet-lipped;
small heads set on slim young throats. The
very incarnation of youth and joy was personified
in the dance before him. The fleetness of
it, the dainty fragility, brought with it a sense
of evanescence. The thought struck suddenly
cold to his heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>Thaïs bent from her chair towards
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How does it please you?” she asked, her
breath soft upon his cheek, her voice like the
tone of a muffled silver bell.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam, it pleases me exceeding well,”
said Peregrine. Meeting her eyes he smiled.</p>

  <h2 id='ch14' class='c006'>CHAPTER XIV<br /> <br />THE QUEST</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>FOR the space of twelve months Peregrine
abode at the Castle Syrtes. During the
first six the life within it pleased him exceeding
well. There was no lack of hospitality;
his presence was very assuredly desired. On
all sides he found himself a favourite, from the
least of the guests to the divine Thaïs herself.
This was enough to please a man who had
found himself hitherto, save for a few weeks of
delusion, of very small importance.</p>

<p class='c011'>He became Head of the Council of Arts as
they termed it, wherein his opinion was most
widely deferred to. The Cult of the Jester
was on all tongues. What precisely this Cult
was I know not, save that it had for its motto
<i>Dum vivimus, vivamus</i>; and that said it is perchance
unnecessary to seek further light on the
matter. I know they talked very blandly of
Sorrow as the highest exponent of Art, whereas
no one of them had ever glimpsed even
the fringe of her garment, though Peregrine
assuredly believed he had. Joy, they contended,
followed close in her path. They
spoke intimately of both. But it is very
certain that none who have not met Sorrow
face to face can hope to meet Joy. Of them
all Peregrine was the only one whom we may
believe laughed now and again at himself. A
very small grace truly, but we may trust a
saving one.</p>

<p class='c011'>For six months, then, he enjoyed himself
mightily, held his Council of Arts wherein
his speeches were most largely adorned with
flowery rhetoric; sang to the ladies in the
garden, and heard their praises of his songs
very complacently; ate delicate food; drank
rare wines; watched dances wherein harmony,
rhythm, and colour lent every lure to please
the senses. At the end of six months he began
to weary, and for the succeeding three stifled
mental yawns to the best of his ability. Now
and again pleasure would rekindle only to die
away to dull ashes. For the last three of the
twelve months he was heartily sick of his life
as it was, but custom by now having wedded
him to the Castle he was somewhat loth to
leave. Also, having in mind the memory of his
travels before he reached the Castle, he saw
not to what end he should depart. Therefore
he dallied. He disguised his weariness
and dislike of the over-soft life well. None
suspected what he thought. It was at this
time he had a dream, which brought his
dilatory spirit to action.</p>

<p class='c011'>One noontide, lying in the garden with the
autumn sun striking full upon him, he drowsed
to slumber. At first, through the slumber,
he was conscious of where he lay, felt the
warmth of the sun upon his cheek; was aware,
though with closed eyes, of the forest which
hemmed in the Castle on all sides. Gradually
consciousness lost its hold upon him, he slid
into a deep silence whence all externals left
him. Then it was that the dream came to
him. With no beginning he found himself
in the midst of it. This is what he
dreamed.</p>

<p class='c011'>He dreamed that he was walking on the far
white road climbing the hillside, the same that
he had seen a year agone. The sun beat hotly
upon it, burning his face, causing the blood in
his temples to drum madly. In front of him
he saw a figure, a cloaked woman moving
swiftly over the road before him. He strained
every nerve in pursuit of her, but for all his
straining she kept ever ahead. The road
became steeper, the sun beat more fiercely
upon him. Yet his desire to reach the figure
before him was so intense that he would not
have halted if he could. But he could not.
He knew that till he reached her he must keep
ever onward. Then beyond her he saw the
tree, its withered branches flung cross-like
from the dead trunk. And on a sudden he
knew that unless he gained her before she
had passed it by he would never reach her.
He tried to run and could not, his feet were
leaden. He could only keep on at the same
dull pace. He saw her now within a yard
of the tree. She had gained it. Some cry
burst from his throat, half prayer, wholly
imploring. At the very foot of the tree she
stopped and turned. With laboured steps he
came abreast her. He saw her face....</p>

<p class='c011'>He woke trembling. The dream had been
very vivid. Yet more vivid than heat or
fatigue was the face of the woman he had seen.
Of one thing he was very certain. It was no
dream face only. Somewhere the woman was
in existence, and from that moment till life
should be ended for him he must seek her. If
in sleep the desire to reach her had been
intense, the desire in waking was threefold.
Here one might say was madness and illusion.
Maybe. Nevertheless it stung him quick to
action.</p>

<p class='c011'>He got to his feet, picking up his cloak from
the ground where it had lain beside him. He
looked around. There was no man in sight.
So much the better, since he was in no mood
either for argument or farewell.</p>

<p class='c011'>Leaving the smooth green of the grass sward
he plunged straight into the forest. Here he
was to experience some of that so-called evil
magic which brought the forest its ill name.
Verily an’ he were so minded he might have
believed the trees and shrubs possessed of
demons so venomously did they seek to bar
his passage among them. Knowing, however,
the thought sheer foolishness he but mocked
at it, and put it from him. The path by
which he had made his way to the Castle had
become overgrown during his twelve months’
sojourn there. The difficulty of his return
route fretted him while it roused him to do
combat with it. Now and again he paused
to break off some branch tough as leather,
requiring the full strength of both his hands
to twist. He became hot and weary, and
very assuredly angry with the difficulties that
beset him. A dogged obstinacy took hold on
him. For the moment he lost sight of the
memory of his dream and the quest on which it
had brought him. Sheer determination to win
through the forest at any hazard sent him
struggling onward. An’ he had to break his
way piecemeal through the forest he would win
his way out. You see him now a very stubborn
man, one not to be kept prisoner against
his own will and pleasure.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yard by yard he made his way forward.
His hands began to drop blood, his clothes
were sadly torn. Two thirds of the forest
lay behind him. An’ he could hold out for the
remainder all were well. He shook the blood
from his fingers which smarted very painfully,
cried courage to his heart, and beat onward.
Here it was that the memory of his dream
returned to him, and further, here was the
pity of it, returned merely as dream. That
was discouraging. It made him appear a fool
for his pains, his trouble to no purpose. For a
moment his heart cried to him to give up the
remainder of his journey, to return on his path.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nay,” he said, very dogged, “’tis a low
suggestion to make a man. An’ I return ’tis
like as not the reality of the dream returns also.
The journey thus far will have been for naught,
and it will be but to make again. I cry
onward.” Which methinks sound reasoning.</p>

<p class='c011'>Stumbling, bruised, and bleeding he made
the last bit of the forest; saw at length the sky
between the trees. Worn out he dropped on
their margin, halting for a moment’s breathing
space. While he lay breathless and panting
the face of his vision returned to him clear and
vivid. Again he knew it for no dream. This
much at least he had as reward for his labours.
He got to his feet on the instant. The
land around him lay in sunshine. Now he
saw what had escaped him formerly in the
dusk, a path through the bog around the
forest. He took it gladly and came out upon
the plain. Here in the sunlight he saw the
great boulders, less ominous now than in the
gathering storm; and far off he saw the white
road climbing the hillside. He knew it for his
goal without doubt, and set off thither.</p>

<p class='c011'>An hour or so brought him to it, and he
began to ascend. He felt the heat of the sun
upon him, bringing his dream clear to mind.
Each moment he thought to see the figure on
the road before him, but it stretched onward
empty up the hill.</p>

<p class='c011'>He climbed steadily; anon saw the tree dark
against the blue of the sky. He pressed forward
towards it. So sure had he been at the
beginning of the climb of finding what he
sought that disappointment fell very hard
upon him when he saw no figure standing
beneath it. Sick at heart he came up to it,
looked around. On every side stretched
dusty grass, sun-baked and dry; and on ahead,
between the stretches of it, passed the white
road. The futility of his quest struck upon
him. He felt himself a deluded man.</p>

<p class='c011'>About to turn bitterly away his eye was
caught by an impress in the dusty ground
below the tree. Bending closer he saw foot-marks,
clear and unblurred, deeply imprinted.
Someone had stood there not long since.
Slight hope to go on, seeing it might have been
a mere wayfarer such as he himself. Yet even
as a drowning man grips hold on a straw so
Peregrine gripped on the faint hope the
impress brought him. He saw now that the
marks passed on along the road. With hope
renewed he followed in their track.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch15' class='c006'>CHAPTER XV<br /> <br />SIMON OF THE BEES</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>IN a valley, hill-surrounded on all sides, with
but a narrow passage between them to
the north and to the south, stood on a time a
hamlet. It clustered for the most part round
the parish church, a small building, with a
square low tower at one end. For all I know
it stands there to this day, though most assuredly
the houses then around it are done
away with. This fact, an’ I were so minded,
might lead me to inscribe sage reflections on
the decay of life, and the passing of time. But
I am by no means disposed so to weary you,
for which mercy you will doubtless cry <i>Deo
gratias</i>, or some such pious thanks. My
business is merely to chronicle Peregrine’s
wanderings on his quest, and to leave sage reflections
to those more apt to deal with them.</p>

<p class='c011'>Winter lay over the valley at this time.
Snow massed upon the roads making them
well-nigh impassable. Wise folk ventured not
far afield, but, returning from enforced expeditions
with speed, made themselves snug between
four walls. Round the same walls the
wind blew shrilly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Within one of the cottages an old man
sat crouched over a turf fire. A wizened old
thing he was, his face crossed and recrossed
with wrinkles, till it was like a withered
brown apple. He stretched gnarled old hands
to the blaze, hands hardened with many years
of holding a spade. Folk said his heart was
as hard as his hands. It may be they spoke
truth. It is certain that if he had a heart,
hard or soft, he kept it very well hidden. None
speaking a good word of him, he spoke a good
word of none. Give and it shall be given you,
was his motto; which being interpreted meant,
An’ you give to me, I will e’en give to you, an
interpretation other than is usual to it. The
motto was not likely to bring him any vast
satisfaction, though doubtless he cheated
himself into imagining that it did. At all
events it was the one he had chosen, and that
to his mind stood for something. You will
perceive, too, that through it he saw himself
against mankind, not mankind against him;
that also stood for something. In his way
he was a bit of a thinker. None knew this for
certain, as he kept his thoughts, if he had
any, to himself; but he was suspected of them.
This was not in his favour. Thinking is for
your student, your philosopher, your priest,
possibly for your lord of the manor. It
comes not into the life of a villain. Work,
food, and sleep; sleep, food, and work are
in the natural order of things; mayhap a
prayer or two to Our Lady and the saints,
and at the last, death, which, being more
pitiful than life, is not ill welcome.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had no kith nor kin; no one and nothing
for which he cared, save his bees. Of these
he had a goodly store, ten hives set in the
garden behind his hovel,—it was little else.
In the summer they made music around him
while he tilled the soil. He found their
droning very pleasant to his ears. By virtue
of this goodly possession he was called Simon
of the Bees. The title was dear to him,
though no man dreamed it. Here was the sole
thing mankind had ever bestowed on him
which afforded him pleasure; yet, since the
bestowal was of careless custom rather than
of charity aforethought, it was deserving of no
reward. Such was his reasoning. It was a
matter of occasional speculation in the village
as to whom Simon would will his bees on his
death, having no kin. It remained, however,
speculation; and was like to do so.</p>

<p class='c011'>On this winter night Simon, warming his
hands over the fire, and muttering now and
again to himself, was roused from his muttering
by a blow on the door. He got slowly to his
feet, grumbling the while, and drew back the
wooden bolt which made it fast. Without, in
the darkness, he saw a cloaked figure standing
in the wind-driven snow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Shelter, for the love of heaven,” said a
man’s voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am none so sure of the love,” responded
Simon, and made to shut the door. In this
he was frustrated by the sudden swaying
of the figure, which fell very prone across his
threshhold, feet and legs without, head and
shoulders on the mud floor of the hovel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A very unceremonious entry,” grumbled
Simon. And he stood for a moment irresolute.
The man could not lie where he was, since his
bulk upon the step made it impossible to close
the door. The wind blew the smoke in eddying
waves about the room. In a moment you
could scarce see a hand’s breadth before your
face. To push him without meant his death
on a very certainty. Directly or indirectly
Simon had never yet had the murder of a
man on his soul, whatever sins else burdened
it. Grumbling more heartily he got his
hands under the man’s arms, and tugged him
forward into the room. Then he made the
door fast again.</p>

<p class='c011'>The smoke now making its way through the
hole in the roof, the air cleared somewhat.
Simon looked down upon the prostrate figure.</p>

<p class='c011'>“An’ he dies within ’twere e’en less pleasant
than he died without,” he muttered. He got
water in a horn cup, and held it to the man’s
lips, forcing it between them. In a moment
or so the man opened his eyes, lifted himself
feebly on his elbow, and looked around.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where am I?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No more original than the rest of men,”
muttered Simon. “There never yet was
swooning man but asked his whereabouts on
coming to himself. Doubtless fearing to find
himself in a less pleasant place than he is
accustomed to. An’ you would know, you
are in the shelter you demanded.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thank you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Simon shrugged his shoulders. “No thanks
are due. You forced an entry.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You might have pushed me without.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And have had your death on my soul.
’Twould be a heavier burden than I’ve a mind
for.” He seated himself again by the fire.
The man watched him from the floor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who you are I know not,” said Simon,
“where you come from I care less, but that
you must bide here the night is obvious.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am rejoiced you see it so,” was the reply.
“My name is Peregrine, a Jester, at your
service. Since I bide here the night ’twere
well we were acquainted, in spite of your little
caring.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Simon grunted. “A Jester! A pretty jest
it would have been for me an’ you had
died on my threshhold. What caused you
swoon?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hunger,” said Peregrine very simply.</p>

<p class='c011'>Simon looked at him from beneath shaggy
eyebrows. Then he got slowly to his feet.
From a shelf he fetched a plate of dark bread.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Eat,” he said briefly, holding it towards
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine fell ravenously upon the coarse
food. A moment Simon watched him, then
turned again to the shelf. From it he took
a piece of honeycomb.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here,” he said gruffly, “’tis toothsome
stuff.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine took it from him. “I thank you
heartily,” he made reply. Simon grunted,
and went back to his seat. From it he
watched Peregrine devour the bread and
honeycomb, lick his fingers of the sticky
sweetness. The simple meal finished, Peregrine
looked across at his host.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Will you give me your name?” asked
Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Simon of the Bees, men call me,” was the
reply given with a regal carelessness. Neither
the regality, nor the would-be carelessness of
the answer escaped Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A goodly title,” he responded, “to which
I am doubtless indebted for a sweet meal.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Simon grunted.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I like bees,” said Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>Simon grunted again. It was his nearest
approach to conversation. Peregrine took it
as such.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Diligent little atoms,” pursued Peregrine,
“busy on their own pursuits. Faithful too;
each choosing its own kind of flower it sticks
to it like a true man to his love. Fearing no
one, they dislike those that fear them, and
show their dislike accordingly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Simon grunted a third time, but approvingly.
He found in Peregrine an observer
of his favourites. A silence endured a little
space; then Simon put a question showing
interest in his guest. This was marvel, had
Peregrine but known.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What brought you hither?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Humph!” said Peregrine. “That is none
too easy a question to answer. Maybe a
dream, maybe a reality. At times I have
thought that which brought me on my wanderings
but the airy nothingness of which dreams
are fashioned; at times I have known it for
more, seen in my pursuit the one solid and
sane action of my life.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Simon gave vent to his usual grunt. “You
tell me little. What is it you pursue?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A woman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I might have known it.” Simon laughed
mockingly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She is not as other women,” said Peregrine
musing. “She has quiet eyes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Truly!” said Simon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I saw her in a dream,” went on Peregrine.
“Now I seek her.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Again Simon laughed. “On your own
showing the quest savours of madness. A
woman with quiet eyes, forsooth, once seen
in a young man’s dream! An’ that is all you
have to go on, how think you to find her?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know not,” said Peregrine very quiet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madness,” said Simon crossly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Mayhap,” smiled Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sheer madness,” said Simon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Quite possible.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Huh!” grunted Simon, and relapsed into
silence. Now and again he looked at Peregrine
sitting on the mud floor in the dim
firelight, his hands clasped round his knees.
From him he looked at the fire, then back
again at the man. Memory, long sleeping,
was struggling to birth in his soul. The lines
on his face quivered now and again in its
travail. On a sudden he spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was once young.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“So are all men once,” said Peregrine very
softly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I too had my dreams,” said Simon gruffly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“They aid a man,” said Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Maybe, and maybe not. ’Twill aid a
man, mayhap, to have a son and see him grow
to manhood. Of what aid is his birth an’ he
wither of some hidden disease in childhood,
suffer and die with none but you to sorrow?
To my thinking no hope at all were better
than hope unfulfilled.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine mused, his eyes on the glowing
turf. “Methinks I find your simile not over
apt. An’ a child of our flesh die, we may see
God’s Hand in the death. An’ a hope of our
heart die, mayhap we are the murderers.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Simon turned on him half savagely. “Is
a mother a murderer that her babe dies in
her arms for lack of the milk in her breasts,
an’ she’d give her life’s blood for it would it
avail? Methinks you must look somewhat
further.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine was silent. Here he found no
answer to give.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sixty year and more I’ve lived here in
this hovel,” went on Simon, “and never a
kindly word spoken to me. I might be the
plague itself for the way men eye me. From
boyhood ’twas the same. Mayhap ’tis something
bred in me they shun. Yet, for all
that, I nurtured hope for twenty year;
dreamed, as you dream now. At last I had
naught left on which to nourish it. It
shrivelled and died. I saw it twist in agony,
for ’twas no easy death. When it was dead
I laughed that it had ever lived. Hope, I
tell you, dying in a man’s soul rots there,
turns his soul foul. Better strangle it before
it comes to birth. Then you can rid yourself
of it. Later you cannot; and dying it lies
there to canker and decay.” He stopped,
and again Peregrine could find no answer.
The wind sighed through the trees without;
all else was silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Did you speak?” asked Simon suddenly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No,” said Peregrine startled, “yet methought——”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Fancy,” said Simon shortly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nay,” said Peregrine listening. “It was
as a voice from far off places. <i>Ego sum
resurrectio et vita</i>, it said.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The wind sighing in the trees brings
voices to a man’s fancy,” returned Simon
crossly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And yet—” said Peregrine wondering.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I too have dreamed,” retorted Simon.
“Hope, I tell you, is dead within my soul.
Yet—yet one fancy remains. An’ it be
not wholly foul, an’ there be one spot of
sweetness left within it e’er I die, perchance
’twill be carried hence by my singing bees.
A mad fancy, and I am e’en mad to dream it.
’Tis cankered through and through. We have
had enough of jargon for the time. An’ you
would sleep, there’s your couch.” He pointed
to a heap of dried bracken in a corner of the
room.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine rose from the floor, crossed to
the bracken, and lay down. Simon sat motionless
by the fire. Without, the wind sighed
among the trees in the valley.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>A sound in the room roused Peregrine the
next morning. He looked up to see Simon
standing by the open doorway. Without, the
dim world was carpetted in snow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You made good slumber,” said Simon
turning and seeing him awake.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Exceeding good,” responded Peregrine refreshed
and cheerful. “And how fared you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“As needful,” grunted Simon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I must onward,” said Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Still mad,” grumbled Simon. “You must
eat first.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He produced more bread and honeycomb.
They mealed in silence. The meal ended,
Peregrine got to his feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“An’ gratitude were substantial reward,”
he said, “you were very substantially rewarded.
’Tis all I have to offer.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis rare enough to be appreciated,” said
Simon very grim.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine laughed. “I bid you adieu,” he
said. He had got to the door when Simon
came beside him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“An’ you would find her you seek,” he
said, “seek her in death’s chamber. She
closes the eyes of the dead.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What mean you?” asked Peregrine. “You
speak in parable.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No parable; in very truth. She has
passed through this village more than once.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have seen her, and yet you term me
mad,” cried Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>Simon laughed. “I have spoken,” he said,
and turned within the hovel.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch16' class='c006'>CHAPTER XVI<br /> <br />ILLUSION</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>THE sun was not yet risen when Peregrine
left the cottage. To the west, behind
the hills, the sky glowed faintly luminous.
Around him the valley lay yet in dusk,
through which the trees and bushes reared
ghostly arms, white-shrouded, very spectre-like.
The air was alive with an intense
purity, exceeding still, yet vital.</p>

<p class='c011'>Away to the right, beyond the church, he
saw a square building. A cross crowning it
at one end, he judged it the retreat of holy
men or women,—monks or nuns. Through the
narrow slits of windows came the gleam of pale
candlelight, showing the occupants of the
building already astir, busy with <i>Ave</i> or
<i>Paternoster</i>, possibly kneeling devout at Mass.
Even as he looked a bell rang out, its clear
tone piercing the silence. Habit caused him
to bow his head. The action was involuntary;
he had done with such matters long since, or
fancied to have done with them. In either
case it comes to the same for the time being.
We need not be nice as to the interpolation of
a word.</p>

<p class='c011'>Turning to the south he took the road
towards the opening between the hills. It
lay, very smoothly white, between a snow-shrouded
wall on the one side, and a fence on
the other. Now he noticed a single line of
footprints in the snow, small and clear, passing
on before him. His imagination fired on
the instant, he followed in their wake. They
led him clean through the village to a pine
wood on its outskirts, beyond which lay the
route between the hills.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sun was up by the time he reached
its edge, gilding the western sky, flooding the
earth with its beams. Following the footsteps
he entered the wood, found himself caught
in its mystic silence. Here was the brooding
stillness, the peace of some vast cathedral.
Between the aisles of the pine trees the
chequered light straggled but a little way.
This emphasized the solitude. The soul of
the place seemed withdrawn from sensible
light and warmth into a great silence.</p>

<p class='c011'>Less conscious of the atmosphere around
him than of the footsteps he was following,
Peregrine pursued his way. A very certain
hope beat in his heart. It was perchance less
hope than certainty. As he walked he looked
not at the trees around him, but at the footprints
on the ground. The snow had fallen
sparsely between the pines, covering the path
but thinly. In the footmarks he could see
the brown of the pine needles, and here and
there a glint of green moss. For the space
of some half hour he walked; the wood extended
further than he had believed on entering
it. On either hand he saw the tracks of
tiny feet, of birds, of mice, of rabbits. Down
a glen gleamed the berries of a rowan tree,
scarlet against the darkness of the pines. A
few fallen berries below it shone blood-red on
the snow.</p>

<p class='c011'>At length he gained the further outskirts
of the wood, came into full sunshine. Here
was moorland stretching upward right and
left to the hills; before him it narrowed to the
pass between them. Some hundred yards or
so ahead of him he saw a rude cottage, mud-walled,
thatched with rushes and bracken.
It stood solitary in the expanse of snow. The
footprints led towards it. You may be very
sure that Peregrine followed the footprints.</p>

<p class='c011'>Coming up to the cottage he peered through
the small square opening that served for window.
Now verily his heart beat to suffocation.
This is what he saw.</p>

<p class='c011'>The middle of the floor held a rough bier; a
coarse linen sheet was drawn over that which
lay upon it. Two candles stood at the head,
their flame pale and insignificant in the sunshine
which fell through the window. He did
not mark a woman sleeping at the far end of
the room, lying, most evidently exhausted, on
a heap of moss and skins. His eyes were all
for a veiled figure kneeling by the bier. Flashing
through his mind came Simon’s words.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Seek her in death’s chamber. She closes
the eyes of the dead.”</p>

<p class='c011'>You may well believe his heart cried, “At
last!” The weary months of his quest sank
from him. He had found her. Past difficulties
had vanished; past fatigue was forgotten
in present rest; past heart-burning in present
happiness. He dared not yet make his presence
known. It was enough that there she
knelt, her head bowed towards the bier. You
see him humbled. He had doubted his dream
at times. It was now embodied before him.
Here was enough to bow a man to the earth, to
abase his soul, the while joy raised it high. So
for a little space he stood entranced. Going at
last to the door, he put his hand upon the latch.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sound of its raising roused the kneeling
woman. She got to her feet. A gentle-faced
nun she stood there, looking at the man
in the doorway.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir?” she said questioningly, her voice very
low.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine was as one turned to stone. His
heart was sick within him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir,” she said again very gently, “what
seek you? Here is death present.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine looked at her. A mad desire to
laugh assailed him. Yet courtesy was ever
strong upon him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Madam, I crave your pardon,” he said
hoarsely. “I—I have made a mistake.”
Blindly he turned from the door, stumbled
out into the snow.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch17' class='c006'>CHAPTER XVII<br /> <br />APHORISMS</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>FOR a time Peregrine was as one distraught.
It may not be far beside the mark to
term him mad. He saw himself in the
past mocked by a woman; he saw himself
now mocked by a man. In both he saw
vaguely the shadow of mockery by a Higher
Power. Truly a hard state. Yet strangely,
for all that, he lost not hold on his quest.
Where heart’s desire had urged him in the
past, fierce obstinacy now spurred him forward.
The face of the woman he sought was
ever before his mind. He believed her withheld
and hidden from him by conspiring Fate.
This roused him to battle. He would move
Earth and Heaven and Hell to find her; die,
if need be, in the attempt. This you may
guess he was very like to do. Already his
wanderings had told on him. It was now
mid-winter, as we have seen, and that season
is not one for e’en the hardiest to be afoot at
all times, dependent on chance for shelter.</p>

<p class='c011'>Of late he had aged considerably. This
was not over strange, since age comes not
with the mere passing of Time, but with the
pressure of his finger in the passing. He had
pressed hard on Peregrine. You see him very
different from the love-bathed youth, who
had sat by the sundial in the flower-scented
garden; the joyous youth, who had wandered
the fields with Pippo; the wounded youth,
who had lain in the wood, his cheek pressed
to Mother Earth; the egoist, who had held his
Council of Arts in Castle Syrtes; who, dauntless,
had fought his way through the forest.
He was a man soul-sick, weary, desperate, pursuer
of a forlorn hope, so men would term it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here it was that a certain duplex side of
his character showed itself. One part of his
nature would have ranged itself on the side
of men, would have stood with them for the
madness of his quest, its mere foolishness
rather. This part of his nature he strangled
very fiercely. Pride had a hand in the
strangling. He would make his quest true,
prove himself no fool. He saw himself in a
sense creator of what he sought. He himself,
by virtue of his belief in the woman, would
materialize her, if she existed but in realms
of fancy. Thus, I say, he would prove himself
no fool. This was veritable madness.
Yet I have told you Peregrine was for the
moment not fully sane.</p>

<p class='c011'>Leaving the cottage of illusion,—this is
what he termed it to himself, and very
bitterly,—he had made for the south, to the
pass between the hills. Descending for a
time, the path had at length led upwards
between more pine woods, like to that he had
lately traversed. Misery and the whiteness
of the snow combined to daze him. He walked
like a man in a trance. Subconsciously his
mind worked, came to the state I have shown
you. In this mood he formed certain aphorisms,
some possibly already known by him;
some new, created from old material.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Cogito, ergo sum</i>,—I think, therefore I
exist,” being the first of them it led easily to
his second.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Thought is a creative power. Think
deeply, and you will create greatly.” <i>Ergo</i>,
by dwelling with every particle of his mind
on the thought of the woman he sought, he
would create her.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hope is a collective force. Terror and
doubt disperse what you have thereby acquired.”
<i>Ergo</i>, hope was the thought by
which he would collect material for his creation.
To allow terror or doubt to work
alongside would be to undertake one of the
seven labours of Hercules.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Desire, being also thought and thereby
creative, brings its own attainment.” <i>Ergo</i>,
he desired the woman he sought and would
attain to her. This was as certain as that a
wheat seed can bring forth nought but wheat.
It became, to his mind, a law of Nature. You
see each of his aphorisms harping to the same
end. Doubtless there were plenty more of
them. Those I have given you will suffice.</p>

<p class='c011'>Coming near the summit of the hill he made
out a wayside cross, backgrounded by the
pines. It stood weather-beaten and solitary.
Here and there the stone was hidden by yellow
fungus and grey lichen. Below it knelt a
figure. For a breathing space Peregrine felt
his heart bound. The next instant he had
himself and his heart well under control.
No second time would he give way to mere
fancy. Here he was very wise. Coming
further he saw a little peasant girl, ragged and
ill clad. At the foot of the cross she had laid
a bunch of holly. She turned on his approach,
looking at him with wide childish eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I give you good-day, sir,” she said shyly,
as he paused a moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good-day,” responded Peregrine, though
in no mood to term it truly good.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I—I have laid the holly there,” she said,
as seeing him still stop she sought for conversation.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A pretty thought,” said Peregrine indulgently.
It was no more in his nature to snub
a child than to strike an animal.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I often bring flowers,” pursued the little
maid. “First there are daffodils and primroses
to bring. They are very fresh and
sweet. Later come bluebells and herb Robert.
They are not so pleasant-scented. Next come
roses and honeysuckle. They are the most
fragrant of all. In the autumn there are
always leaves, which are as pretty as flowers,
when they are red and gold. Now there is
holly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is pretty too,” said Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes,” replied the child. “But it is sad.
It is very thorny, and the berries are red like
blood. When I see it I think of the crown
of thorns, and Christ’s death.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A sorrowful fancy,” said Peregrine, and
somewhat uneasily.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis not a fancy,” averred the child,
discriminating nicely. “’Tis a thought. Fancies
may not be over good.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Truly,” smiled Peregrine, finding amusement
despite himself at the earnest tone of
the small discriminator. “What manner of
fancies, may I ask?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Gravely she surveyed him. There was no
mockery in his smile. An’ there had been
she would have held her peace. Instead she
cogitated, seeking to make her meaning clear.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know,” she said wisely after a moment,
“that there are evil spirits in the world. They
roam abroad, especially in darkness. I used
to fancy we were all safer from their power
from Christmas till Ascension Day. I fancied
Christ truly on the earth during that time.
After Ascension Day He seemed further away,
and sometimes I was frighted. I told this to
Father Bernard. He said that it was merely
fancy. He said Our Lord was ever present
now upon the earth in the Blessed Sacrament,
in greater glory now than when He lived on
earth before. I have forgotten what more he
said; but I am no longer frighted when Ascension
Day is past. You see, what I held before
was fancy, and—and—I cannot tell you
rightly, but Father Bernard would show you
that fancies are not the same as thoughts.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Humph!” said Peregrine, having no mind
to test the perspicacity of Father Bernard or
any other priest on the matter. He hitched
his cloak closer around him, ready to start
again on his way. The movement disclosed
his tabor hanging by a frayed ribbon from
his neck. The child saw it; curiosity was
quick astir.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What is that?” she demanded, finger
pointing.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My tabor,” returned Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tabor?” she queried. The word as well as
the instrument was unknown to her. “What
is a tabor?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“A musical instrument,” said Peregrine,
smiling at the little ignoramus.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Music!” Her eyes sparkled, her cheeks
glowed. “Ah, play it!” This was on a note
of deep entreaty.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine shrugged his shoulders. Here
was an interlude in his former mood of blackness.
It was not wholly distasteful. You
have seen that he favoured children. He
found quaintness in this one.</p>

<p class='c011'>“What shall I play for you?” he demanded,
unslinging the instrument.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Play while I sing,” she said firmly. “That
will sound well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine chuckled. “Truly that depends
on the singing,” quoth he. “On, then, with
the song.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Birdlike her voice rose in the pure air.
Peregrine catching the melody came in with
the tabor. Here is what she sang.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There,” she cried triumphant, as she
ended, most innocently pleased with the
performance, “I said it would sound well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Liquid silver notes from a throat of gold,”
said Peregrine, verily astonished. “An’ I
had not other matters on hand, you and
I might well roam the world together,
and men would truly hearken to us, or
they are greater dullards than even I judge
them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked at him with longing eyes. His
words held open a vista of bliss before her.
But she shook her head sadly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It cannot be. I have work to do,” she
said sorrowful.</p>

<p class='c011'>“For that matter so indeed have I,”
quoth Peregrine. “What manner of work is
thine?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I mind my father’s goats,” she responded.
“What work is yours?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I seek some one,” said Peregrine grimly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some one you have lost?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Some one I have never found,” was the
answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh,” responded the child perplexed. Then
shyly, “I must be about my work. I thank
you, sir. God speed you with your seeking.”
Waiting for no response she nodded to him,
turned off into the pinewood.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine went slowly on his way.</p>

<p class='c011'>The interlude had come happily. There is
a healthful sanity in a child’s company, even
if it endure but a brief space. Peregrine felt
his mind somewhat cleansed of the murkiness
which had enshrouded it. He began to
picture the woman he sought as present with
him. This eased his mind for a while, even
though it tantalized. It lifted him to a more
exalted mood. He identified her with the
Spirit of Life around him, saw her passing
over the snow swift-footed, fancied her coming
from among the pines towards him, heard
her voice in the light breeze which stirred
them. He held her thus in his thought
throughout the day. He saw her image in
the glowing sunset, fancied the purpling light
across the hills the spreading of her veil. So
far so good. With the night, fatigue descended
on him. There comes a point in this
state when fancy cannot readily be embraced,
nor even held though formerly present.
Reality is required upon which to rest the
mind. This Peregrine had not. Fancy slipping
from him left him desolate. He was
also very hungry. Fate had thrown no dwelling
in his path whereat he could beg bread.
Therefore he had not broken his fast since
early morning. The needs of nature joining
with desolation of mind to bear him down, he
found himself heavily weighted.</p>

<p class='c011'>Darkness lay around him. The sky, which
at close of sunset had clouded, brought very
meagre light to guide him. Only the faint
glimmer of the white road before him gave
him his route. He stumbled on, sinking at
times knee deep in the snow, where it lay
drifted beneath the wall.</p>

<p class='c011'>The wind began to rise, and with it feathery
flakes came silent and insidious. They
touched his cheek like soft cold kisses. You
would never have dreamed danger in their
tenderness. They came faster, thicker. The
wind swirled them in a dancing maze. A few
steps further, and a blizzard was upon him.
The wind rushing from the north smote him
that he could barely stand. The snow leaped
and flashed around him, blinding, suffocating.
He staggered on doggedly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“An’ I stop now I never find her.” That
was his thought, barely articulate even to his
own mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>In his stress forgotten habit came to him.
A prayer rose to his lips. He put it swift
aside. Long ago he had prayed, believed in
prayer, in God, in a woman he had created,—a
woman who had prayed. She had mocked
at him; cast him from her. Therefore he had
put her and her beliefs from him, and with
them his own, being like to hers. In this you
see sheer stupidity, and rightly. The Creator
is not responsible for hypocrisy in His creatures.
That is where the Devil comes in with his
handling of matters. This Peregrine had not
seen formerly, nor was like to do so now,
blinded and stupefied as he was by his conflict
with the snow.</p>

<p class='c011'>Putting prayer aside, then, he trusted to his
own efforts. It is certain that he lacked not
courage of a kind. His arm up shielding his
face, he struggled on. His breath came in
sobbing gasps. A dark mass looming before
him brought him to a halt. From out the
mass gleamed a faint light piercing the snow-driven
atmosphere. He took a step towards
it, and sank in a drift to his thigh. For a
moment he struggled, but to sink the deeper.
Well-nigh spent, drowsiness was falling on
him. It seemed that further effort availed
him nought. As well rest now as not; rest
and sleep.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the blinding snow around him he thought
he saw a woman standing. She came nearer,
bending to him. Now indeed he cried, “At
last!” and stretched out his arms. Even as
he cried, he saw her eyes. They were avenging,
terrible.... The snow was like a white
flame round her....</p>

<p class='c011'>Shuddering with more than cold, he looked
full at her. Then unconsciousness fell upon
him.</p>

  <h2 id='ch18' class='c006'>CHAPTER XVIII<br /> <br />THE SAGE</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>MENIPPUS LACHESIS, sitting in his turret
chamber, was poring over a parchment.
You may be very sure this was not the name
with which his parents had started him in
life. It was with one simpler. I have heard
it rumoured that once on a time he was known
as Thomas Herdman,—a good honest appellation
truly. That time, however, was now
many years old, and rumour can easily go
astray; indeed, rumour wandering from the
mark more often than not, there is little credence
to be put in that quarter. At all events
it is sufficient for our purpose that he was now
known as above set forth,—Menippus Lachesis,
the Sage, reader of the riddle of the stars,
gazer of crystals, philosopher of numbers, and
penetrator into the secrets of life. Many
men sought his wisdom, and if they left him
little the wiser, through the multiplicity of his
words or the brevity of his cryptic utterances,
either of which was given them according
to their needs as figured by Menippus, that
doubtless was due to their own lack of receptiveness.</p>

<p class='c011'>The turret chamber was a circular room
hung with twelve blue curtains. To the north
the curtains were indigo; they then passed
through shades of sapphire to a clear light blue
at the south, and back again through sapphire
blue to indigo. Here you have shown the
darkness of the winter months, lightening
through spring to summer, and back again to
the darkness of winter. Each curtain was
embroidered in gold with its own sign of the
Zodiac, from the Ram, through the rest of
them to the Fishes.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the table near him, lying on black velvet
the better to avoid reflections, was an
egg-shaped crystal. A pretty enough thing
it was, with its smooth surface clear and
very luminous, true rock crystal, wherein your
least initiated may gaze with advantage, so
termed. For my part, I will take leave to
question the advantage. By the crystal stood
a gold vessel, cup-shaped, quaintly wrought
with devices, of which the most obvious was
the pentagram. It held a purplish liquid of
the consistency of ink.</p>

<p class='c011'>The room had no windows. At all times it
was lighted by a small hanging lamp, two gold
wings bearing between them a red glass
holding oil and a burning wick. For the
better lighting of the place when the Sage was
at his studies, there were a couple of candles
set in bronze candlesticks.</p>

<p class='c011'>Menippus, reading from the parchment,
paused now and again to peer into the gold
cup, or look a moment towards the crystal.
That some weighty matter was under consideration
might be judged by the wrinkling
of his brow, and the tapping of his clawlike
finger on the table. A tall man, this Menippus,
he looked the part himself, or Fate, had given
him exceeding well. His hair, white and
plentiful, fell straight on either side his face,
and to the nape of his neck. His moustache
and beard were of glossy silkiness. The
latter, pointed, touched the third button of
his black gown fashioned not unlike a priest’s
cassock, the sleeves only being somewhat
wider and looser. Round his neck hung a
gold chain, and from it a gold device. The
centre thereof was a small cross set within a
triangle. Without the triangle was a circle,
and without the circle a second triangle.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the forefinger of his right hand he wore
a large seal ring, the setting blackened silver,
the seal itself very ancient, reddish stone,
carved with devices as follows: Man in his
potential divinity (I give the reading Menippus
would have given you) before the Fire
Altar, backed by the Pillar of Truth, and
looking towards the Trinity (Pagan), Man,
Woman, and Child: these three surmounted
by the Supreme,—a Woman crowned with the
Sun; behind her, the Cornucopia, before her,
the Caduceus; behind the Pillar of Truth,
the Crescent Moon, horns pointing upwards;
above it, a seven-pointed star. About his
head he wore a thin gold fillet, in the centre
was placed a Rising Sun. To those versed in
such matters the sun, the ring, and the symbol
at his breast showed him as belonging to the
Ancient Order of Lux. An exceeding ancient
Order this, Egyptian, and dating from far
beyond the time of Solomon.</p>

<p class='c011'>Where and how Menippus received his
initiation into this Order was a mystery, but
that his initiation was more than the mere
wearing of the symbols of the Order, he proved
in vastly more ways than one. The few who
came to his tower to leave it with greater
knowledge than was contained in multiplicity
of words and brief cryptic utterances,
left it with sealed lips, but with hearts wherein
awe and dread were strangely intermingled.
Such power as Menippus showed them was
unquestionably power, but whence it came
was another matter.</p>

<p class='c011'>A high-nosed, thin-lipped man he was, his
face yellow like the parchments he studied.
His eyes, black as sloes, and very piercing,
were set beneath shaggy eyebrows. The
lids of them folding far back at his will, left
them at times staring and unblinking. This
gave them an hypnotic power. At other
times, when in deep thought, they cut across
the pupil of the eye; then you saw the eyes
heavy-lidded. This alteration of the eyelids’
form was a marked characteristic of his.
It set the hearts of curious women—those who
sought his wisdom—a-beating; more than once
sent them scuttling like frightened hens to the
door, and adown the stairs, while Menippus sat
chuckling cynically. Weak enough to desire
his power to be sought and acknowledged
by all men, mere curiosity bored him vastly.
You may judge that he was more often bored
by his visitors than not. Vanity alone made
boredom worth the enduring. It was a
strange quality to find in a man of his age
and power. Pride and unscrupulousness one
might well expect; but here was a strain of
weakness running through his strength, one
which had endured from his earliest years.
It is perchance needless to say that but for it
he would have been greater than he was, and
he was no small man intellectually no more
than physically. This same vanity had led
him into works no man dare even name with
impunity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Turning now from the parchment before
him, he fetched a deep sigh, let his gaze rest
ardently on the crystal. Now you see the
heavy lids cutting the pupils in a straight
line. An’ you had seen more, had seen with
those same heavy-lidded black eyes, you would
have seen the crystal cloud to milkiness, first
a mere drop in its clearness, spreading gradually
across the whole. The cloudiness gave
way to light, sudden and brilliant, at first
many-hued as a rainbow, then turning to a
clear whiteness. Across the whiteness rode
a ship full-sailed. Here was the definite
signal of on-coming vision. Next, and you
must take the vision with what credence you
may, he saw a man struggling through a snowstorm,
blinded, dazed. He watched more
closely. Could you have read his mind, you
would have known the sight not unexpected.
It held the interpretation to certain cryptic
utterances in the parchment spread before
him. I do not pretend to understand how
these things may be; I but give you as plainly
as I am able all that chanced on that night
of snow and storm, and that which followed
after. With the powers that leagued together
in the handling of the matter I desire no
dealing. An’ the whole happening had not
close bearing on the history of Peregrine
it might well be omitted. Being, however,
close bound with him at the moment, and
with that which was to befall him later, it is
incumbent on me, and I would be a fair
chronicler, to set it plainly forth. In the
crystal, then, Menippus saw a man struggling
through the snow, saw him coming ever
nearer, saw him sink at last as we have seen
him. At this the vision was obliterated.
Returning to concrete surroundings, he saw
the crystal lying on the black velvet, catching
the glow from the hanging lamp, naught
else pictured within it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Menippus got quickly to his feet, made
his way to the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Castrano,” he called.</p>

<p class='c011'>A huge negro came silently from behind a
curtain.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come on the instant,” said Menippus.
“I need your aid. A man lies in a snow-drift
without.”</p>

  <h2 id='ch19' class='c006'>CHAPTER XIX<br /> <br />THE CHOICE</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>PEREGRINE, returning to consciousness,
and unaware at the first of his surroundings,
believed the snow to be an exceeding
warm bed. This being so he lay still a while,
very grateful for the repose to his aching
limbs. Anon he opened his eyes, saw above
him a dark arched roof, over which light
flickered, saw before him the steady flame of
a small lamp. This phenomena struck him
as curious to find in a snow-drift, brought him
to further investigation. Now he found that
he lay not on snow, but on a couch, soft and
luxurious, warm covering spread over him.
Marvelling greatly he turned his head, found
himself in a room, saw the flickering light to
come from a wood fire on a great hearth.</p>

<p class='c011'>By the hearth a man was sitting reading
from a large book propped on a stand before
him. Behind him was a shelf holding bottles,
crucibles, and other glass vessels, some containing
dark shapes, exceeding unpleasant to
look upon. On three pedestals stood three
figures; Clotho, who according to the Ancients
spins the Thread of Life; Lachesis, who sees
to its guiding, and whom Menippus had taken
for his patroness; Atropus, who cuts it when
she and her sisters will. Peregrine looked at
this last with interest. He fancied she had
but lately had her shears in hand for him,
frustrated only by her sister, Lachesis. In
this thought he possibly shot pretty near the
mark.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he saw that Menippus had turned
towards him, was surveying him gravely, the
while one skinny finger kept the place in his
book.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So you have come to yourself,” said
Menippus.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have evidently you to thank as my
rescuer,” said Peregrine struggling to his
elbow.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Lie still,” said Menippus briefly. “It
is sometimes doubtful whether thanks are
due in such a matter. On this occasion,
however, believing that you owe them, I
accept them from you. It were well that you
rested for a time. I would, however, converse
with you. What brought you hither?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Foolishness,” said Peregrine very dryly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There I take leave to differ from you,”
remarked Menippus. “Curiosity or wisdom
might have led you an’ you had come of set
purpose. Believing neither to have had a
hand in the matter, I see rather the guidance of
my patroness Lachesis.” Turning he bowed
towards one of the three figures.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Truly,” smiled Peregrine ruefully, “her
sister had her shears ready to the thread.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha! you recognize them. That is well.
Yet, despite the guidance of Lachesis, I can
fancy you imagined some guidance of your
own?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rather the guidance of a myth I pursued
to my own undoing,” said Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There again I must make correction,”
remarked Menippus very suavely. “Whatever
myth you pursued, you pursued it to
your advantage, since it led you hither.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have it your own way,” laughed Peregrine,
“I am too weary to do combat with
you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Menippus took his finger out of the book
and leaned back in his chair. He looked
gravely at Peregrine. There was a note in
the laughter which showed less respect than
he considered his due. Briefly, his vanity, a
tender commodity, was pricked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Putting for the nonce,” he said, “laughter
aside, I would have you speak more plainly.
Show me shortly the myth you pursued.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here was a slight air of command, which
for a moment stung the Jester. The next,
humour prevailed. He saw matter for amusement
in the evident seriousness of the other.
It was plain that he took himself by no means
lightly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Well,” quoth Peregrine, “since you desire
brevity in the account you shall have it. I
had a dream, a vision, call it what you will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What manner of vision?” demanded
Menippus.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The vision of a woman,” replied Peregrine.
“Though it was but in vision I saw her, I
believed her to exist in reality, hence I set out
to find her. I have pursued her for over a
year. Plainly, I know not truly whether she
exists or no. At times I have been certain
of her reality; at times the certainty has
fallen from me. A moment or so agone it had
left me. Now, in speaking of her again, I am
very sure she lives. There is the matter in a
nutshell. ’Tis a tantalizing enough quest for
a man, and maybe I am a fool to pursue it.
At times I see the folly very plainly, at times
I see in it naught but the clearest sanity.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Menippus drew down his eyelids. His
finger-tips together he spoke smoothly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Presuming the quest sane, presuming it
fulfilled, what think you to gain when you
have found her?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That,” said Peregrine quietly, “will lie
between her and me.” The Sage’s tone had
struck strangely on his heart. It brought
with it at once hope and danger. Here it is
none too easy to make my meaning clear. It
was as though, on the one hand, the Sage had
knowledge of the truth of the quest, yet, on
the other, would put hindrance in its way.
The full articulation of the thought came
not entirely home to Peregrine; he but scented
the matter as it were from afar. The Sage’s
next words brought amazement to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know the woman you seek,” he said
briefly. There was no mistaking the assurance
of the tone.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have seen her?” he cried, even as he
had cried to Simon.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Verily I have,” returned Menippus.
“Now listen. Pursuit of her is of little
avail; that you have fully proved. I know
her dwelling. She welcomes not all men to her
presence. That you have had vision of her
shows me that she desires yours. There is no
need to question at the moment how this may
be. We, who study the riddle of the Universe,
know well that there are matters which lie
beyond the comprehension of ordinary mortals.
Doubtless you would find it hard to
understand how I should have been aware of
your presence in the snow-drift without making
use of my physical faculties,—in this case
the sight of my eyes. Nevertheless I did
know, and to my knowledge is due the fact
that you are now lying upon that couch.
That is to us a simple matter, the A B C of
our Science. In fact I doubt me that it goes
beyond A. It is a mere question of vibration,
to which the customarily accepted channels
of communication are a hindrance rather
than a help. You will discover this in the
case of the blind. Deprived of the coarser
physical attributes of sight, which read merely
the heavy and slow vibrations, the mind is
alert and attuned to the light and quick
vibrations, which are, in a sense, of spirit
rather than of matter. To make my meaning
clearer,—one possessed of physical sight
interprets rightly the vibrations received from
an object before his eyes. This object emits
heavy vibrations, which reach and correspond
to the physical vibrations of the eye. Every
object, whether near or far, whether hidden
or actually apparent, emits vibrations, since
all matter is alive. But,—and this I would
have you note particularly,—that which is
afar and hidden emits lighter vibrations, which
cannot so readily be interpreted by a human
being, who is, by reason of the possession
of his physical senses, endowed with coarser
vibrations. This is not always the case.
There are those, who, in full possession of all
their physical faculties, are yet able to receive,
and at times interpret, the lightest vibrations
in the Universe. But this is rare. You may
take it as a general rule, that a blind man is
more readily sensitive to hidden objects than
one in possession of his sight, more readily
aware of the presence of the quick and light
vibrations of the spirit world. Again, a deaf
man can receive the vibrations of sound from
that same world, where one in possession of
his hearing is dulled to them by reason of the
presence of the coarser vibrations. This, no
doubt, is strange to you, nevertheless it is a
fact.” He leaned back in his chair with a
sigh, as of one who should say all this is mere
child’s play, yet it were well to give it to you.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Candidly, I find it exceeding bewildering,”
said Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Under my tuition the bewilderment will
pass,” said Menippus indulgently. “I see
you rarely endowed. You need but guidance
and teaching in the matter. This I propose
to give you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine smiled somewhat grimly. “I
doubt that you find in me an over-apt pupil,”
he returned. “Also, to what end may the
teaching be? And how shall it lead me
further on my quest, which I tell you very
plainly I mean to pursue?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Menippus pointed to the door.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There,” he said, “is your way out. You
can leave me on the instant an’ you will;
pursue your quest your own way. You have
proved whether it has so far been successful
or no. If, on the other hand, you abide here
with me, receive the instructions I will give
you, I will lead you anon to the woman you
seek. By yourself you will never find her;
through me you will. You may see my words
fairy-tale invention an’ you choose. You
have free choice in the matter. Think well
on it.” He turned calmly to his book, bending
close over the pages. For aught of consideration
he now gave Peregrine he might
have been non-existent.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine lay still, gnawing his finger
thoughtfully. Truly he did not particularly
like the turn of matters. There was an
unhealthy atmosphere about the close-draped
apartment and the man’s words which he
found distasteful. An’ the woman were indeed
in existence he had rather trust to his
own self to find her. Yet....</p>

<p class='c011'>In this word he summed up the past year
and more; saw himself weary, footsore, hungry,
moreover sick at heart, and no nearer
fulfilment of his quest, to all appearance, than
at the outset. Here was definite promise of
fulfilment. It was the unhealthiness of the
man before him that displeased him. He saw
the face of the woman clear-eyed, wonderful,
as he had seen her on the first day of his
vision, not as he had seen her as he lay in
the snow. That he believed now to be but
the distorted image of a fevered imagination.
How should the woman he knew in his dreams
have dealing with this old Sage? In one
breath Peregrine found the notion unendurable;
in the next, an’ the Sage spoke truth,
he saw here the only means of meeting with
her. Yet did he speak truth? There was
the crux of the whole question. Perchance it
were wisdom to stay a while, and put the
matter to the test. An’ the promise were not
proved, he could set out anew on his own
account. In the meantime he must stay
as pupil. This he found somewhat nauseating
to his mind. His senses now more fully
awake, he found the odour of the room strange,
a curious mixture of burning herbs, incense,
and with it the scent of accumulated dust.
No breath of outside air reached his nostrils.
The atmosphere was as unwholesome physically
as his mental conception of it. Thus
he vacillated between remaining and departing.
Finally he made his choice. Truly it
was made somewhat sulkily, and for lack of
seeing a better one.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will remain,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>Menippus raised his head, looked at him as
one bewildered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You spoke?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I said I would remain,” returned Peregrine
a trifle testily. When one has stated a difficult
and reluctant decision, it is none too
pleasant to be obliged to repeat the statement.
It is in a manner lowering to one’s
dignity.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You do well,” returned Menippus calmly.
“Yet I would have you bear in mind it is by
your own free will that you remain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am wholly aware of it,” retorted Peregrine.
This insistence on the matter displeased
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will now,” continued Menippus still
calmly, “send for food. You must eat.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I need food strangely little,” quoth Peregrine,
“seeing I have gone hungry the
whole day, and, I judge, well into the
night.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I gave you a cordial when we carried you
within,” returned Menippus briefly. “There
was food and drink in its strength.” He went
to the door and clapped his hands.</p>

<p class='c011'>Into the room came Castrano, the negro,
bearing on a tray dishes of various meats, and
decanters of wine. He placed them on a table
and withdrew. Peregrine got off the couch.
He and Menippus ate together. He found the
meal exceeding palatable. On its conclusion
Menippus turned towards him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will now show you the room where you
will sleep,” he said. He lead the way along
a passage and to a door. Beyond it was a
winding stair in a turret. Menippus entered
the room with him; a small place it
was, furnished with necessities and naught
beyond.</p>

<p class='c011'>“The place is at your full disposal,” said
Menippus. “I make you my guest in confidence.
There is but one stipulation I would
put to you. The winding stair beyond your
chamber leads to precincts which are my
concern alone. I pray you leave them unmounted.
Since you are a man it is safe to
make this request. An’ you were a woman
it would send you up them in haste at the
first opportune moment.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Humph!” said Peregrine, leaving the
cynicism unanswered.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And now I bid you good-night,” said
Menippus.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Sage departed Peregrine sat down on
his bed. By the light of a candle he surveyed
the place. The walls were ochre-washed; the
floor bare board, none too clean. Cobwebs
hung about the ceiling; a waiting spider or
two made dark blots on the soft grey nets.
The bed was a straw mattress on wooden
trestles, and covered by a somewhat mangey
bearskin. A wooden chair, a rough oak
chest, and a table made up the remainder of
the furniture. Above the table was a slit
of a window set far forward in a deep
embrasure.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine crossed to the table, mounted it,
and peered through the slit. The storm had
spent itself. The world lay in still whiteness
 without. Overhead the sky was star-sprinkled,
powdered with myriads of waking
eyes. Peregrine felt strange comfort in their
watchfulness.</p>

  <h2 id='ch20' class='c006'>CHAPTER XX<br /> <br />VIBRATIONS</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>TIME being the panacea for most ills as
we are told, so we may well regard
custom as the panacea for most distastes.
It is certain it proved a panacea for Peregrine’s.
Active dislike being presently dulled
to indifference, interest anon awakened.</p>

<p class='c011'>You cannot long remain in the company
of an ardent believer without receiving some
touch of his beliefs, be they in God, the Devil,
or himself. Menippus believed in the two
last, more particularly in himself, being fully
persuaded that while the Devil lent him some
little aid he could most readily have dispensed
with his services altogether, have relied
entirely upon his own power. Doubtless the
Devil, his master, being most politic, endorsed
this theory, the while he laughed in his sleeve.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine, exceeding open to influences,
sucked up the mental atmosphere around him
as a sponge sucks up water. He had no
notion of his own tendency. An’ he had, he
might have been the better on his guard,
though here a man’s own skill is of little
avail, he needs truly to put on the armour of
light, as the Scriptures have it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Being permeated, then, with the atmosphere,
he lost his distaste, found interest awakening.
This latter was small wonder: an’ you had
conquered dislike there is little doubt that
attraction would follow. There was mystery
enough in the Sage’s doings to stir curiosity,
marvel enough to carry one forward, and a certain
matter-of-fact exactitude, withal, which
threw any hint of pure charlatanism aside,
forced reality to the front, even while it brought
dread with it.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the first he merely instilled certain teachings.
Here are some of them.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Vibration,” he said, elaborating on the
outline he had formerly given Peregrine, “is
the first law to study. There is no single
thing in the universe which does not emit
vibrations,—matter, colour, light, and sound.
To comprehend the whole riddle of life is but
to attune oneself to the reception of these
vibrations, and interpret them rightly. Like
rushes to like. To make my meaning clearer,
sound—the crash of a falling tree for example—emits
vibrations to the ether. They travel
across it till they reach some instrument
attuned to receive them. Such is the normal
human ear within a normal distance of the
falling tree. The vibrations lessen in force
the further they travel. Beyond a certain
distance the physical ear is not sufficiently
sensitive to receive them. But it is only
on their reception by the instrument that
the sound becomes interpreted in terms
of fact. To an ear beyond the normal distance
of sensing the vibrations, there would
be no sound, because of the lack of its
sensitiveness in receiving and recording them
as they weaken. This would not prove
their non-existence in the ether, but merely
the defect in the instrument which might
have received them. Have you followed
me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine frowning somewhat, but not uninterested,
made known that he had done
so.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Here,” quoth Menippus, “I have dealt
with the merely physical and actual. This
same question of vibration extends to our
reception of the vibrations of form, light,
and colour by the eye; of the vibrations of
scent by the nostrils; more grossly to our
reception of the vibrations of form and
quality by the touch. Leaving the more
material, we will pursue the matter further,
dwell for a moment on thought. The vibrations
of thought, though quicker, lighter,
and therefore less easy of reception by the
heavy and material vibrations of ordinary
mortals, are yet infinitely more powerful,
infinitely more enduring than the vibrations
from material objects. I give it as my
experience that the vibrations of a thought,
strongly sent forth, can endure throughout the
centuries. Hence it is that certain sensitized
minds can receive the vibrations of
thoughts of bygone ages. These they believe
to be their own, having made, to their knowledge,
no study of them as the thoughts of
others.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here Peregrine, who had followed the
argument closely enough, demurred. Having
a brain of his own he now used it to some
purpose.</p>

<p class='c011'>“But,” he argued shrewdly, “if, as you
say, all new thought as men hold it, is but the
vibration of thought of bygone centuries,
where will you allow the beginning of thought?
Presumably at one time it must have been
new.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This one might have imagined a daunting
question. To attempt to push it to a conclusion
in accord with the views Menippus had
just set forth would mean a staggering delving
into infinite æons of time before which the
finite brain might well reel.</p>

<p class='c011'>Yet Menippus had his reply ready.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All thought is but one expression of the
Universal Mind, which has known no beginning,
and will know no ending,” he remarked
gravely.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine was silent. He found himself
neither sufficient theologian, philosopher, or
scholar to gainsay this vast statement. In a
sense he saw it might be truth, yet found it in
a manner vaguely distorted by the mirror of
speech in which it was reflected by Menippus.
He ventured on another query.</p>

<p class='c011'>“How an’ the thought be evil?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rightly speaking,” returned Menippus,
“there is no evil. All vibration flows in harmony
from the Universal Mind. The imperfect
or wrongful reception of those vibrations
by the material vibrations of man, sets up
discord. This men term evil, and believe
therefore that evil vibrations have flowed
from without towards them, rather than
recognizing that the fault lies in themselves.
Those who attune themselves rightly can
receive the whole stored up thought and
knowledge of the centuries. This is wisdom,
and wisdom is power.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here was the mere jargon of his trade. It
is true there were some who believed this
doctrine they preached. Excellent sounding,
and none too easily refuted, it had deceived
more questioners than Peregrine. Yet it is
very certain that Menippus, though he had
it ready enough on his tongue, held it not in
his mind. Frankly, he saw two powers in
the universe, or better speaking three, since
I have shown you in what estimation he held
his own. An’ the matter be put plainly, he
had sought to make the other two subservient
to his. This, in the one case, meant deliberate
warfare, finally sheer ignoring; in the other, he
saw himself victor and master, recognized not
at all that he was slave.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here was the beginning of his teaching.
Later he led him further, gave him in outline
some inkling of the founding of the Order of
Lux. For what it is worth I set it forth here.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Order, so said Menippus, was of great
antiquity. It was founded by three Egyptian
Seers, psychics of much power. For the space
of nine moons they had sojourned in the desert,
food and water being brought to them by
messengers. They spoke to none save each
other. Now at the ninth month, at the full of
the moon, they saw the Sign of the Triangle in
the Heavens, and the three stood in a circle,
making the Sign of the Triangle each with
his own hand and that of his neighbour,
thumb to thumb, and forefinger to forefinger.
And the names of the three who did this were
Pharos, Zadkiel, and Ramah. And above
the Triangle they saw the Lotus Flower, and
above the Lotus Flower the Sign of Triple
Power; while the whole was backgrounded by
the Sign of the Rising Sun, though it was yet
moonlight when they looked on these signs.
And they heard, so says the legend, a Voice
speaking to the three, which bade them return
to the Inner Temple, and in seven weeks the
seven rules of the novitiate should be made
known to them, for each week a rule. And
in seven months should the seven rules of the
brotherhood be made known to them, for each
month a rule. And in seven years should the
seven rules of the priesthood be made known
to them, for each year a rule. Thus in seven
years, seven months, and seven weeks from the
first seeing of the Sign, was the Order of Lux
perfected. And the three cast lots as to who
should be chiefest among them, for they were
all three of a royal house. The lot fell upon
Zadkiel. Then he entered into the silence for
seven days, and the seven rules of the High
Priest were made known to him, for each day a
rule. Now, none but the High Priest and one
other know these seven rules: the High Priest
tells them to his successor. But lest there
should fall mischance of the death of both, and
for fear lest the rules be lost, they have been
written, and placed in a casket kept in the innermost
Sanctuary of the Temple, and the High
Priest alone possesses the key of this casket.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now here is a further matter which is somewhat
strange. Though the Order is the Order
of Lux, and its chief symbol is the Rising Sun,
the Temple where the casket lay was the
Temple of the Moon, in the plains of furthest
Egypt. Here the Moon Ritual was performed
by the Ancients each month.</p>

<p class='c011'>All this Menippus told Peregrine. Further,
he told him that one night at the full of the
moon he should see the ritual as it was performed
by those ancient priests, and, moreover,
see the priests themselves. At this you
may well believe Peregrine found himself
somewhat incredulous; but it is certain that
later his incredulity was shaken.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch21' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXI<br /> <br />MOON RITUAL</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>THIS chapter may well be omitted by the
incredulous. For my part I know not
fully whether to see in it mere hypnotic influence,
or some power more evil. Possibly
both had dealing in the matter. As it occurred,
I will give it you, as briefly as may be,
since I have little liking for these doings.</p>

<p class='c011'>One night, the moon being very clear and
full, Peregrine was roused from slumber by a
rap on his chamber door. Opening it he saw
Castrano the negro without, bearing a lantern
in his hand.</p>

<p class='c011'>“My master, Menippus, bids you follow
me, an’ you would see that which will chance
in the Temple this night,” he said shortly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Donning his clothes anew, and wrapping
his cloak around him, Peregrine prepared to
follow the negro. The latter led the way in
silence to the hall, and thence down vaulted
passages which struck with a strange chillness.
From the manner of their descent Peregrine
perceived that they led underground, penetrating
deep into the earth. They were hewn
out of rock and stone, very rough and jagged.
Far above him was their arched roof plastered
in some manner.</p>

<p class='c011'>After walking five minutes or so, Castrano
came to a halt opposite a great door, nail-studded.
This he opened, and in the dim light
Peregrine saw steps descending. Castrano
led the way down them; signed to Peregrine
to take his place by a pillar, indicated a stone
seat, whispered an injunction to remain where
he found himself, and so left him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine’s eyes becoming accustomed to
the gloom, he looked around him. It was a
dark vaulted place, very lofty. In each of
the four corners, barely discernible through the
darkness, were huge marble statues. To the
left was an arch containing seven hanging
lamps, their dim flame casting a faint light
upon a dark object below it. What this
object was Peregrine knew not. It appeared
to be a cabinet of black wood.</p>

<p class='c011'>In the middle of the Temple was a stone
pillar some three and a half feet in height, the
base pentagnol, the capital slightly hollowed.
Smoke ascended from it in a misty blue
column. The burning substance upon it gave
forth a strange heavy scent. Above it hung
a lamp half hidden by the ascending smoke.
Around the pillar, on the black marble floor,
was drawn a great circle in white chalk. An
outer circle surrounded the floor of the whole
Temple. This Peregrine saw but faintly, and
only as he peered from right to left, marking
all that reached his eye.</p>

<p class='c011'>His gaze coming back again to the pillar,
he saw Menippus standing near it, within the
inner circle. He had not marked him previously,
and believed this to be his first appearance.
He was standing motionless and rigid,
robed in purple, white, and scarlet; Peregrine
felt his eyes drawn to him by some impelling
force.</p>

<p class='c011'>For a space Menippus remained thus; then
Peregrine saw him slowly stretch out his arms.
Through the Temple came his whispered voice,
gradually gathering in force.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<i>Adonay! Adonay! Adonay!</i>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c015'>came the cry. And then again louder.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<i>Adonay! Adonay! Adonay!</i>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>It seemed to Peregrine that the atmosphere
around him trembled, as the cry came floating
through the Temple. And then it came a
third time.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<i>Adonay! Adonay! Adonay!</i>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Now it penetrated to the furthest corners,
echoed hollowly in the vaulted roof. He was
very sure that the air shook.</p>

<p class='c011'>Still the cry went on, and with it further
words. They were uttered in Latin. For
your better understanding of the ritual I give
you the translation. The utterance of the
words came in curious waves of sound, rising,
falling, beating through space; collecting, so
it seemed, power and force, in their inexorable
rhythm.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“<i>Adonay! Adonay! Adonay!</i></div>
      <div class='line'>Thou that dwellest in the spaceless void,</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>Adonay! Adonay! Adonay!</i></div>
      <div class='line'>Thou that dwellest in the illimitable silence,</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>Adonay! Adonay! Adonay!</i></div>
      <div class='line in4'>Bring to us thine aid.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>The voice fell to silence; a breath of wind
swept through the Temple.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“<i>Adonay! Adonay! Adonay!</i></div>
      <div class='line'>Indomitable Ruler of the Firmaments,</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>Adonay! Adonay! Adonay!</i></div>
      <div class='line'>Invisible Wanderer of the trackless stars,</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>Adonay! Adonay! Adonay!</i></div>
      <div class='line in8'>Lend to us thy power.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>Again the wind swept through the Temple,
falling once more to a deathly stillness. Small
points of light focussed, broke, and scattered
through the gloom.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in2'>“<i>Adonay! Adonay! Adonay!</i></div>
      <div class='line'>Majestic Creator of the Vast All,</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>Adonay! Adonay! Adonay!</i></div>
      <div class='line'>Breath of the Boundless Universe,</div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>Adonay! Adonay! Adonay!</i></div>
      <div class='line'>Give to us creation and the breath of life.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>And then, lastly, the supreme utterance
given with the whole collective force of will:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>“<i>Messias Soter Emanuel Sabaoth Adonay, te adore et invoco.</i>”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>Now the wind swept through the Temple in
a volume, swaying the lamps till their chains
jangled, beating down the smoke from the
pillar till it spread in clouds around it. Again
the stillness fell. The air around the pillar
cleared.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now Peregrine saw four figures standing
by it, where previously there had been but
one,—men robed in purple, white, and scarlet,
as Menippus was robed; and round the forehead
of each was a gold fillet fronted by the
Rising Sun. From whence they had made
their appearance he knew not, but it is very
certain that the awe brought to his heart by
the sweeping wind remained with it in their
presence. The still air felt almost ice cold.
Peregrine shivered, and drew his cloak closer
around him the while he gazed, his eyes
rivetted upon the pillar and the four figures.
While fully aware of their actual presence, he
was yet imbued with a sense of unreality,
and more especially a sensation of unsafety.
He felt somewhat as a man might feel, who sees
poisoned arrows falling round him, and knows
himself vulnerable at every point. An’ he be
not wounded, it will be by some good chance,
rather than by any protection he can afford
himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>Then he saw that another light had entered
the Temple,—pale moonlight falling straight
upon the circle where the four stood, though
from whence it entered he knew not. Now
he heard chanting coming from the four; saw
some ceremony was in progress. This was
none too easy for the uninitiated to follow.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the first they stood, arms wide-spread,
rhythmic syllables falling from their lips in
measured tone, with curious undulation and
dwelling on the vowels. It seemed, indeed,
naught but vowels that they uttered with the
wailing cry as of some Banshee. Next, the
cry dying away, they bowed themselves in
silence to the earth, touching the black marble
floor with their fillet-bound foreheads.
Then, standing again upright, the figure nearest
him went up to the pillar, took from it
with a pair of golden tongs, what appeared
to be glowing charcoal. This he placed in a
gold censer. Standing, then, beside the pillar,
Menippus, who faced him, came towards him,
blew upon the charcoal till it glowed to deeper
crimson. Half unconsciously, through the
ritual, Peregrine found his brain recording
sentences. Here was the first.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>And the Wind of the North shall blow upon
the Fire of the South that it increase in fervour,
since from the South cometh the Purifying Fire.</i>”</p>

<p class='c011'>Menippus moved back to his place, and the
figure to his right came forward. This one
scattered drops of water on the pillar, which
hissed as they fell among the burning mass.
Next Menippus came down, breathed upon
the vessel the figure held.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>And the Wind of the North shall blow upon
the Waters of the East, that they quench not the
Fires of the South.</i>”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here the figure holding the vessel of water
carried it to him with the censer. Thrusting
his hand into the vessel he scattered drops
upon the charcoal in the censer. Again
there was a sound of hissing; but the smoke
from the censer continued to ascend. He
stepped back, and Menippus came forward,
signing symbols over the water, finally scattering
drops around the pillar and upon the
other three.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>And the Wind of the North scatters the
Waters of the East, purifying those on whom
the drops shall fall.</i>”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now he again returned to his place, and
the figure to his left came forward. From a
bag of purple stuff he drew forth grain, threw
it on the pillar where it was caught by the
fire, and flame sprung up. Once more Menippus
came forward. Here he took grain from
the hands of the figure who held the bag,
carried it to the figure bearing the censer,
threw grain on the censer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>And the Wind of the North shall carry the
offering of the West, that it be purified by the Fires
of the South.</i>”</p>

<p class='c011'>All four now returning to their former
places, again the wailing chant rang through
the Temple with ever increasing insistence.
The vibratory strength of the ascending and
descending cry brought back to Peregrine’s
mind somewhat of the Sage’s teaching. He
perceived in it new meaning, felt, in a measure,
the vibrations correspond with other subtle
vibrations in the atmosphere around him.
Together they formed a strange harmony.
Now he saw Menippus stand with arms again
outstretched, saw the figures South, West, and
East, scatter burning charcoal, grain, and
water upon the ground, found his brain again
recording words, even though they were not
heard in actual sense by his ears.</p>

<p class='c011'>“<i>Thus purified upon the altar, further purified
by the breath of the Wind from the North, we
return these gifts to the Earth, in the Name of
the Great Lord Adonay, Creator of the Universe,
Lord of the World, Ruler of all Creation, of
the Elements, of things animate and inanimate.
Adonay! Adonay! Adonay!</i>”</p>

<p class='c011'>Now they moved in measured tread around
the pillar, chanting as they went. Nine times
they circled it, coming at length to a stand
in their former position. The chanting now
held a tone of praise rather than of invocation.
Words after this fashion came to his mind:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>

<p class='c014'>He saw that the moonlight was shifting.
It no longer fell full upon the circle. The
chanting came with a tone of finality. He
received now no sense of words, knew merely
that the ritual was drawing to an end.</p>

<p class='c011'>On a sudden the chant ceased. An extraordinary
silence fell upon the Temple. At
the same instant he saw that the three figures
had disappeared. Menippus alone stood rigid
by the pillar. Peregrine found himself trembling.
A slight sound drew his eyes to the
dark object before the archway. A face, white
and frightened, was peering from it. Peregrine
made a quick step forward. On the
instant his arm was seized. Turning he saw
Castrano.</p>

<p class='c011'>“It is ended,” whispered the negro, and
hurried him from the Temple.</p>

  <h2 id='ch22' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXII<br /> <br />DEVIL WORSHIP</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>PEREGRINE found his interest fired by
these matters that I have shown you.
Menippus giving solid proof of his power, he
doubted not that eventually at his will he
could make good his word, bring him in contact
with the woman he sought; though, to speak
truth, his desire for the meeting had somewhat
lessened. There was enough here to absorb
his mind. Subtle flattery led him to belief in
his own power. He saw himself presently a
rival of his teacher, his equal if not his master
in the possession of knowledge.</p>

<p class='c011'>This led him to desire quicker advancement
than Menippus was willing to allow. He
knew full well there were at times mystic
ceremonies in progress at which his presence
was not requested. They were held in the
Temple. This he learned by midnight prowling.
Soft-footed he had slipped more than
once from his chamber. The guidance of a
murmuring voice had led him to the Temple
door. Courage was not strong enough to
bring him to an entry; his ear pressed against
the door he had listened. Here and there he
caught a Latin word, isolated enough to bring
him no inkling of the context. Curiosity fell
hot upon him. He had made scrupulous avoidance
of the turret stair. Menippus having
put a request in that matter, honour as a
guest bound him to its observance. Here he
felt no such qualm; it was merely that he
lacked courage to turn the handle of the door.
An’ he could gain knowledge of what passed
within, without Menippus being aware of his
entry, he would do so.</p>

<p class='c011'>He set himself to think. Observance showed
him, that on such nights as the murmuring
voice proceeded from the Temple, Menippus
first made visit to the precincts beyond the turret
stair, moreover marked that when he descended
again he was not alone. This brought
him to a conclusion. In the future he sought
not his couch before midnight: ear alert he
awaited the Sage’s ascent of the stair.</p>

<p class='c011'>Six nights he waited to no purpose. Judging
the passing of time by the march of the
moon across the sky, he relaxed his visit
when she was over, or near, a yew tree without.
He made allowance each night for her later
rising. Clear skies favoured this reckoning.
The seventh night, patience being by now well-nigh
exhausted, and sleep lying heavy on his
eyelids, he heard a footfall without, marked its
ascent of the turret stair. Here was his opportunity.
He slipped softly from his chamber,
and adown the corridor.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had time enough for his purpose. Never
less than twenty minutes or so had elapsed
betwixt the Sage’s ascent and descent of the
stair. He passed down the corridor, made
his way to the dimly lighted hall, and thence to
the vaulted passages leading to the Temple.
The silence was profound: here in the passages
darkness reigned. He groped his way along
them, feeling to the left for the Temple door,
as he had felt more than once already. Anon
his fingers touched it. Excitement beating
high in his heart, he found the handle, turned
it softly. The door did not yield to his pressure.
Bringing his shoulder to bear against
it, he found it locked. Here, at the moment
he believed his purpose accomplished, defeat
faced him. An’ he had not waited seven
nights for this moment the disappointment
had been less hard to endure. Now he felt it
very bitterly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Casting about in his mind what next course
to pursue, he saw on a sudden from afar whence
he had come, a swaying light. A dim speck
at the first, it grew larger. There was small
doubt but that it came from a lamp carried
by one approaching the place where he was
standing. To remain where he was were
madness. Turning, he groped swiftly down
the passage away from the light.</p>

<p class='c011'>Some twenty paces or so further he found
the wall come to an end. Feeling cautiously
he found the passage turn leftwards. An’
the bearer of the light stopped at the Temple
door, this gave him cover. He paused to
listen, ready to make further flight should the
steps come near him. He heard them echoing
softly in the vaulted spaces; anon they
came to a halt. He fetched a deep breath of
relief. He heard the turning of a key.</p>

<p class='c011'>Waiting to be sure of safety, he saw on a
sudden a gleam of light above him, perceived
that it came from a square opening in the wall.
His brain worked quickly. Someone within
the Temple had lighted a lamp or candles.
Here was a wall of the Temple, and a window
giving on to it. An’ he could gain the window,
chance had brought him a safer means of
viewing the ceremony about to take place than
had he ventured through the door. Also he
saw no means whereby he could now enter
undiscovered. Had he guessed at the truth
of the happening, he would have known that
Castrano had forgotten to make the place
ready; had come swiftly to repair the omission,
and return to his couch before Menippus
arrived at the Temple. Even now Castrano
was leaving it, and Peregrine would have
found entrance easy; though for exit later I
am none so sure.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine felt the wall below the window.
The stones, rough and jutting forward in
places, would afford him slight foothold. He
set himself to climb. Grazing knee and hand
somewhat, and with danger of a fall, he gained
the aperture above him. It was a square
opening, barred, giving on to the Temple
within; sufficiently deep, too, to afford him
seating of some sort. He saw clearly the risk
of Menippus glancing towards it, perceiving
his crouching figure. This risk he was ready
to take. There is naught to be gained without
some venture. Getting his seat secure,
and holding to the bars, he looked within.
The place was as he had seen it on the night
of his entry there, save that, instead of the
stone pillar in the middle of the floor, there
was now an altar against the wall to his right.
Peregrine guessed some new ritual about to be
performed.</p>

<p class='c011'>No one was in sight. Whoever had lighted
the candles on the altar had now withdrawn.
Peregrine debated for a moment, had idea of
making descent, of trying again the Temple
door. This thought he put aside for two reasons.
First, he ran grave risk of coming upon
Menippus; second, he saw himself vastly
safer without the Temple than within it.
He drew his cloak close around him, trusting
to its darkness to give appearance of
shadow in the embrasure, and waited.</p>

<p class='c011'>He had not long to wait. The door opened:
through the gloom Peregrine saw two figures
enter, one small, in size no more than a child.
He heard the lock turned behind them. An’
he had possessed courage sufficient to try the
door formerly, it would have availed him
little.</p>

<p class='c011'>The figures descended the steps, came forward
towards the light. Now Peregrine saw
them plainly, a small boy dressed as an
acolyte, and swinging a golden censer; behind
him Menippus vested as a priest. They came
before the altar. Then Menippus began to
speak. Familiar words struck on Peregrine’s
ear, setting his heart thumping. He heard
the boy’s voice come in with response,—a lifeless
voice, as of one drugged.</p>

<p class='c011'>Heart and brain sick, he crouched rigid.
Here was horror of which he had never dreamt.
But for the bars, he had made an entry at
whatever danger to life and limb, stopped
the horrid sacrilege. He could not look at it.
Slithering from the wall, bruising himself in
the descent, he gained the passage, made
along it, and thence to his own chamber.
Here he found his breath coming in deep
sobs.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I had not known,” he said; and sank upon
his knees.</p>

<p class='c011'>Shuddering he knelt there, knowing nothing
of the passing of time. Horror had beaten
upon his soul: his body was numbed. This
was where his quest had brought him. Dazed
and sick he found his strength spent.</p>

<p class='c011'>Steps passing his door brought him to himself.
Wit in a measure returned, he saw
that flight must be his with no delay. Then
another thing struck him. He thought of
the child he had seen. What an’ he had
been trapped to this pass? Peregrine saw
not his own flight without some assurance
on this score. To leave the child were sheer
cowardice.</p>

<p class='c011'>He waited; presently heard Menippus descend.
A moment or so later the place lay in
dead silence. Peregrine made for the door.
No thought of honour held him now. He had
his foot upon the turret stair, was up it in soft
bounds. Atop he came upon a door, a staple
pushed across it. To pull it back was but an
instant’s work; the next, he had entered the
chamber.</p>

<p class='c011'>The moonlight fell across the floor, and
upon a couch. On the couch lay a boy, a
small thin child. He started up on the sound
of the opening door, turned a pitiful face, and
great dark eyes towards it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yes?” he queried, alert, ready for bidding.
Then on a sudden he shrank. “Who is it?”
he asked fearfully.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hush!” whispered Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, who is it?” pleaded the child frightened.
“I am blind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The pathetic utterance smote straight to
Peregrine’s heart.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You poor little misery!” he ejaculated on
a note of tenderness. “See here, listen well.
I wish you no ill, naught but good. Bide you
willingly here?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The boy fell to trembling. “Willingly?
Ah, no!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Was what you did this night willing
service on your part?” asked Peregrine,
striving to keep severity from his
voice.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I know not what I did,” replied the boy.
“I act as he bids me; I say words which he
has taught me. Knowing not their meaning
yet I dread to say them.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That,” said Peregrine very low, “is well.
Will you trust yourself to me?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sir,” replied the child, “I know not who
you are. But, an’ your heart is like to your
voice, I trust you very freely.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine smiled grimly. “We’ll leave my
heart out of the question,” he said. “Truly
it, or my own foolishness, has brought me to a
pretty pass. Would you leave this place an’
you could?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The boy started from the couch.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will take me from it! Ah, sir, sir!”
Groping towards Peregrine he found his hand.
Down on his knees he fell to kissing it with
fervour.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine hauled him to his feet.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Save your gratitude till the matter is
accomplished,” quoth he. “We have first to
make our way from the place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This brought the child to his senses. “I
know not how that may be done,” he faltered.
“Castrano sleeps across the hall door. I have
heard him snore as we passed the hall from
the Temple. There is no other way out.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then we must make a way,” said Peregrine
very cheerfully. “And first you must
put on some clothes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He found doublet, breeches, and hose lying
on a chair; aided the boy with their donning.
The child clad himself, ear alert, fearful of his
own breathing. Long imprisonment he had
borne with resignation: hope bringing life to
his heart quickened it also to fear of hope
frustrated.</p>

<p class='c011'>The boy garbed, the two slipped softly down
the turret stair, careful of each footfall.
Thence they gained Peregrine’s chamber.
Here he made the bolt fast: this gave him, he
felt, breathing space.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Since no exit can be made by the door,”
he remarked, “we must e’en make it by the
window. ’Tis somewhat narrow, but I have
had my head through it more than once;
and where a man’s head can pass, his body
can certainly follow. You, I think, can go
through it with ease.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Crossing to the bed he pulled a rough
woollen blanket from below the bearskin.
With the aid of a knife he proceeded to tear it
into strips. These he knotted firmly. Mounting
the table, he threw one end from the window
measuring its length.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis somewhat short,” he said peering
downwards, “and ’twill mean a drop, but
with luck no bones need be broken. First
I will lower you, then make descent myself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He hauled up the improvised rope. Making
one end fast to the table, he knotted the
other under the boy’s arms.</p>

<p class='c011'>“When I come down above you,” he said,
“I must needs cut the rope below me, and let
you fall. Get to your feet on the instant, and
go some paces away, that I fall not on the top
of you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He helped the boy to the table, put him
through the window.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You must trust me,” said Peregrine
kindly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh, I do!” replied the boy fervently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Keep off the wall with your feet, an’
you can,” said Peregrine, and began to
lower.</p>

<p class='c011'>The rope paid out to its fullest, Peregrine
got to the window himself. On the ledge he
dragged the table upwards, wedged it across
the narrow opening.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pray Heaven the rope bears us both,” he
muttered. “There was no other way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Feet braced against the wall he began the
descent. To the child below it appeared an
eternity before Peregrine’s foot touched his
shoulder.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ha!” said Peregrine. “Now prepare to
drop.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Swinging by one arm he felt for the rope by
his knees, and hacked. A moment’s work,
and it gave. The boy rolled on the grass
below, none the worse save for a slight
jarring.</p>

<p class='c011'>“All well,” he whispered, scrambling away
from the wall. Now Peregrine dropped lightly;
was up in a moment but little shaken. He
looked at the hanging rope.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Leaving traces of our flight behind us, we
depart,” he said grimly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Taking the boy by the arm he made swift
way across the grass, out of the moonlight,
into cover of an adjoining wood.</p>

  <h2 id='ch23' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIII<br /> <br />ABBOT HILARY</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>ABBOT HILARY came riding through
Thorn Wood when the morning was
yet young. Matters ecclesiastic having taken
him from Dieuporte three days previously, he
was now returning to it. Going leisurely
enough, conning his breviary as he rode, he
found time to sniff the good morning air,
mark the chequered lights and shadows on
the moss and on the tree trunks.</p>

<p class='c011'>A portly man this Abbot, shrewd-eyed
and kindly. Big-voiced, you heard his tones
quaking an’ they thundered forth reproof:
solemn in absolution, you heard them like a
deep-toned bell guiding you to harbourage
from storm. With a heart as big as his
voice, he loved mankind hugely; found excuse
for the sinner even while he denounced the
sin. His brain, alert within his massive head,
was quick to detect lying and fraud. This
he hated very deeply, as generous men hate
such dealings. He loved the open air and
God’s sunshine, his mind as healthy as his
robust body.</p>

<p class='c011'>Riding now leisurely enough, muttering
Latin psalm the while he rode, his eye roving
now and again from the open page of
his breviary to the dappled sunlight around
him, he checked his horse on a sudden, bringing
the Latin phrase on his tongue to a like
halt.</p>

<p class='c011'>At the foot of a tree he saw a white-faced
boy stretched upon the ground. His attitude
showed exhaustion; the whiteness of his face
faintness possibly akin to death.</p>

<p class='c011'>Abbot Hilary was off his horse in a trice,
despite the somewhat unwieldiness of his size.
Hitching the bridle to a crooked branch of a
tree he made over to the boy, came down
on his knees beside him. Slipping his fingers
beneath the doublet he satisfied himself that
life was not extinct, and thereupon fell to
chafing the child’s hands. A crackling in the
bushes behind him stayed this business for a
moment, brought his head round to see who
was approaching.</p>

<p class='c011'>From out the trees came a tall man garbed
in motley, bearing a broad leaf carefully in his
hands. On seeing the figure by the boy, Peregrine
came quickly forward. Heeding the
bearing of the leaf less well the water it contained
trickled from it to the ground.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Let the child be!” cried Peregrine very
sternly.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Abbot got to his feet, faced him, a big
man astounded.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Truly,” he said on a tone conciliatory,
“I meant the boy no ill. Seeing him lying
there fainting and alone, I but sought to restore
him to consciousness.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I crave your pardon,” said Peregrine
quickly, very apologetic, “I thought ’twas
another knelt beside him: one with whose
company we may very well dispense.” He
looked now ruefully at his leaf. “And like a
fool I’ve spilled the water,” he remarked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You fetched it from the stream yonder,”
said the Abbot, knowing Thorn Wood well,
every inch on it. “Methinks ’twere simpler
matter to carry the child to the stream than
bring the stream to the child. In the first case
we can be more lavish with our restorative.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine laughed. “You speak very
truly,” quoth he.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Abbot picked up the fainting boy
from the ground, lifting him as though he
lifted a mere featherweight, and straightway
made off in strides among the trees, Peregrine
following in his wake.</p>

<p class='c011'>Down by the water,—a narrow silver
stream flowing among ferns and mosses,—they
laved the boy’s temples and wrists, got drops
between his lips. Anon he came to himself,
sat up somewhat feebly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I will come on the instant,” he cried
faintly, his mind back at the place he had left.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Tut, tut,” spoke Peregrine soothingly,
“never trouble yourself, child. There’s no
more coming and going for you at that scoundrel’s
bidding.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, I forgot,” cried the boy fetching a
deep breath of relief. “Who else is here?”
he asked on a sudden.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Rightly speaking,” said Peregrine smiling
at the Abbot, “I know not myself. But
assuredly ’tis one who has befriended you
very well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Abbot laughed, big-voiced and hearty.
“I am one Hilary at your service, Abbot of
Dieuporte,” said he. “Methinks ’twere well
you both accompanied me thither, that this
child may there gain rest from evident over-fatigue.”</p>

<p class='c011'>This proposal fell well enough on Peregrine’s
ears as far as it concerned the boy. For his
own part he had yet further to travel, though
he was willing enough to accompany them to
the place, wherever it might chance to be.
Keeping his own plans silent for the moment,
however, he acceded readily enough to the
Abbot’s suggestion. Picking up the boy again,
the Abbot led the way back to his horse.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Do you mount,” said he to Peregrine,
“and take the lad before you. Methinks
you, too, have done walking enough for the
present.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here Peregrine demurred somewhat, being
loth to take such summary possession of the
other’s horse; but the Abbot pressed his point.
Presently mounted they moved on at walking
pace among the trees. Lulled by the movement
the boy fell asleep, lying snug in Peregrine’s
arms.</p>

<p class='c011'>“An’ it be not impertinence,” said the
Abbot, “might I ask whither you two were
faring when I chanced on you?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis no impertinence,” laughed Peregrine,
“yet it is a question to which I can find no
answer, since truly I knew not myself.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hmm!” mused the Abbot, drawing down
his eyebrows.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine, seeing the boy sleeping, now
began to talk more openly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“This child,” said he, “has been in the
possession of a very evil scoundrel. It is
true that I have been heartily gulled by him
myself. Now I know him in his true colours,
which are certainly very black and filthy.
Two nights agone we made our escape from
him; since, we have wandered the woods,
eating blackberries to stay our hunger. I
can fend well enough for myself. For the
boy it is another matter. Therefore I see
very clearly that Providence sent you in our
path.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Truly,” said the Abbot, “I see His guidance
in all ways.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do not,” returned Peregrine very frankly.
“But then it is not probable that you have
followed paths like to those I have traversed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Abbot smiled, humorous, though grave.
“I meant I saw His guidance in the paths
He bids us follow. An’ stiff necked we follow
those of our own choosing, methinks ’tis the
Devil leads the way.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine rubbed his chin. “There I am
with you very freely. But how about this
child? He found himself in paths where truly
I can see none of God’s guidance, and would
hesitate to say I saw the Devil’s leading,
since assuredly the path was no choice of
the boy’s.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Abbot Hilary mused, looking down among
the trees. “God has His Own methods,”
he said presently. “At times He leads by
strange paths, which, were they of our own
choosing, would soil us sadly; but, since for
some hidden purpose of His Own He takes us
by them, He leads us through the mire
undefiled.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine nodded quick assent. “Here you
have given clear tongue to the matter. The
child that lies in my arms has been present
with evil, yet he is not evil. Unwittingly
he has taken part in the worst sacrilege,
yet he is no sacrilegist. Thus much I have
learned from him. How he came to such
straights he knows not. He has no memory
for aught but the place from which I brought
him. An’ you can gain full speech from him
as he gave it to me, and cleanse his mind from
memory of past foulness, ’twill be well for his
soul.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For a few moments the Abbot made no
answer. Then he said quietly, “What do
you propose for the boy?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That he remain with you,” returned
Peregrine on the instant. “In the first place,
I am no fit company for him; in the second
place, he is blind and needs safe harbourage;
in the third place, he should learn forgetfulness
of the past, which you can teach
him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“And how for yourself?” replied the Abbot
smiling.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine’s face fell to rigid lines.</p>

<p class='c011'>“For myself, I have a quest before me; perchance
a goal to reach. Twice I have been
deluded, put off the track. It may be death
will overtake me e’er the quest be fulfilled.
That must be as will be. I only know I must
pursue it.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The Abbot was silent a while, his eyes bent
upon the ground. Methinks, by the movement
of his lips, he uttered some inward
prayer. Anon he spoke kindly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You spoke of a goal perchance to be
reached. How know you that same goal lies
not at Dieuporte? For my part I have a very
fair inkling that it is so.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine shook his head. “You may be
right, but I do not think it is. Yet, an’ you
will take the boy, you will be doing a goodly
deed.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That I will do readily enough,” replied
the Abbot gravely.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here a silence fell. And so they pursued
their way among the trees. Great beech trees
they were; the trunks grey and purple, flecked
with green and silver; the leaves russet and
brown, toned by the touch of autumn.
Long shaded glades stretched on either hand.
Now and again a rabbit scuttled down one of
them. Small stirrings among the undergrowth
bespoke the presence of dormice, squirrels,
and other woodland creatures. The silence
was occasionally broken by the harsh note
of a pheasant.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anon ascending somewhat, and the trees
thinning, they had glimpse between them of
a valley beyond lying in autumn sunlight.
Here there were more woods, blue in the hazy
distance. Coming from among the trees,
Peregrine had sight of grey towers in the valley;
judged, and rightly, it was Dieuporte
lying in its peaceful shelter. Now they began
to descend. The way led adown a lane bordered
on either hand by blackberry bushes
laden with dark luscious fruit. At the bottom
a stream crossed it, stepping stones affording
traverse for foot passengers. Now the road
widened, lying between sedgy meadows, where
cows stood in the shadow of the willows.
After a mile or so it turned leftwards, and
here Dieuporte lay straight before them.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sight of its grey towers stirred Peregrine
strangely. For a moment he found
himself ready to believe the Abbot’s words, to
see his goal within the quiet place. Now I
know not precisely why he put the thought
aside; but, methinks that being twice deluded
by the words of men, he had no mind to find
himself deluded a third time; thought rather
to trust to his own self in the matter. Yet,
for all that, the sight of the place moved him
strangely, as I have said. He felt like a man
travelling in very barbarous lands come within
sight of a home. And further, felt that within
that home dwelt one long desired, long needed,
yet never attained. Some mighty power
seemed to draw him to it even while his spirit
rebelled.</p>

<p class='c011'>Telling himself imagination and illusion
were present with him, he set himself to
combat it. Had not bitterness from past
disappointment been present with him, perchance
he might have read some omen in the
still hush of the autumn air, have found in it
a tenseness as of expectant waiting. The
red-dyed leaves hung motionless on the trees
above him as he rode, rusty, stained as though
with blood. The combat within his soul was
sharp and fierce. His own will gained the
mastery. He strangled the thought, flung
it aside as rank sentiment. A little breeze
passed around him, stirring the leaves on the
trees. It came like a breath of regret. Perchance
Abbot Hilary recognized it unwittingly,
for he sighed.</p>

<p class='c011'>The boy moved in Peregrine’s arms,
yawned, and presently awakened.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Where are we?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“At a place where you will be in safety and
well tended,” returned Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will be with me?” asked the child
very anxious. And the Abbot waited for the
answer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nay,” responded Peregrine. “I have
further to travel. But you need have no
fear. An’ I were not assured of your welfare
I would not leave you. You will bide here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>There was finality in the words which the
child did not gainsay. Too long had command
been known to him for him to be unwitting
of its tone. Peregrine felt him tremble
in his arms, but no word came from his
lips.</p>

<p class='c011'>The Abbot knocked upon the Mercy Door.
It opened, showing a lay brother standing
within.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Take the horse,” said the Abbot to him
after a word of greeting.</p>

<p class='c011'>The brother departed with it, the Abbot
turned to Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are determined to continue your
journey?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am determined,” replied Peregrine
briefly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, well,” returned the Abbot cheerfully,
“God’s times are not always as ours. You
will at least wait till I send food to you here.
You have fasted long enough, methinks.
Blackberries make but poor sustenance. You
may rest assured of the boy’s welfare. You
did good service when you rescued him.
Farewell, my son, and God speed you on
your quest.” He paused a moment, looked
at him very searchingly. “An’ I were to
prophesy,” he said smiling, “I should tell
of your coming to your goal e’er long. Fare
you well.” He passed across the courtyard,
his hand on the child’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anon, with a well-filled wallet, Peregrine
turned his back on Dieuporte, made his way
adown the valley.</p>

<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c004' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch24' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIV<br /> <br />AT DIEUPORTE</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>E’ER we follow Peregrine in his further
wanderings, it were well, methinks, to
remain a brief space at Dieuporte. To leave
on the instant the child committed by him to
Abbot Hilary’s care, were to my mind to
leave him somewhat summarily. An’ you are
of my way of thinking, have found interest
in the boy, you would know something of
his further welfare. Having brought him to
harbourage, it is restful to dwell a short time
with him.</p>

<p class='c011'>You may be sure the child found the Abbey
restful. In the first place, it held a rare atmosphere
of sanity and homeliness. Herein it
differed from the dwelling he had left as
greatly as good wheaten bread differs from
tainted dishes. In the second place, he experienced
safety in the presence of the big
Abbot and his colleagues. This he felt
without fully realizing that he did so. His
mind, hitherto tensioned to an unwholesome
strain by the very evil will of Menippus, now
found entire relaxation. He slept, ate, and
slept again, his strength vastly recuperating
thereby.</p>

<p class='c011'>He spent long hours in the sunny garden,
mainly in company with young Brother
Francis, to whose charge the Abbot had
specially allotted him. Here, in spite of his
blindness, he became aware of the beauty
around him. He felt the soft wind, heard its
rustling in the trees; heard also the low notes
of the wood pigeons; smelt the sweet scent of
the flowers. In the quiet orderliness of the
place, its stateliness, yet its simplicity and
its homely happiness, his rightful heritage of
childhood, long denied him, came to birth.
He lost his furtive look, ceased to start at
sudden sounds; his peaked face grew to
plumpness, a delicate colour tinged his cheeks.
Anon, he was heard to laugh. This sound
pleased Brother Francis vastly, and the Abbot
no less.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having good care for his body, they forgot
not his soul. There was no proof he was a
Christian. Having been in the charge of
Menippus from babyhood the Abbot saw the
matter more than doubtful. Gentle questioning
of the child led him to pretty full knowledge
of the manner of place from which
Peregrine had rescued him, and the corruption
in it. Of the truths of Christianity he
was entirely ignorant. Here the Abbot took
instruction upon himself. This required careful
handling, since to bring knowledge of
truth home to him was at the same time to
show him more fully the evil by which he
had been surrounded. What Menippus had
taught most foully must now be taught in its
full beauty. Briefly, to bring him to the sunlight
were at the same time to make him aware
of the darkness of the pit he had left.</p>

<p class='c011'>Figuratively speaking we see the Abbot
holding him in strong arms while he looked
backward on the horror. The tears that
came at the knowledge of it Abbot Hilary
dried; the shuddering he stilled. He told
him an ancient history. This was the story
of the Three Holy Children cast into a fiery
furnace. He told him they had walked the
flames unscathed, since One was with them;
their garments,—even the hair upon their
heads,—escaping the smallest scent of fire.
From it he drew a moral bearing on the
boy’s own case. The child listened wondering,
and greatly comforted. The horror of uncleanness
fell somewhat from him at the tale.
Also, for his further comfort, the Abbot told
him of Baptism, and Forgiveness for past
wrong.</p>

<p class='c011'>The boy drank in his teaching eagerly.
The very sensitiveness of his mind, which
Menippus had used for his own ends, made
him the more open to present influence.
Body and soul, he expanded, like a bud in the
sunlight; it needed but the seal of pardon,
like the kiss of the sun at noontide, to bring
his soul to full flower.</p>

<p class='c011'>He knew himself by no name. Menippus
had given him none. “Boy” was sufficient
for his needs. It had been, “Boy, come
hither; Boy, do this.” Now known more
tenderly as “Child” it were yet well that the
presently Christian should have a Christian
name.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here Brother Francis arraigned the saints
before him for his selection, gave him their
history in brief. This was pleasant enough
occupation. To sit on an old stone seat in
the garden, to hear the humming of the bees
among the flowers mingling with the musical
voice of Brother Francis, was a joy to the small
selector. He lent grave ear to the telling.
Coming to St. Michael he embraced him
readily. Here was warrior enough to delight
his heart. He saw himself well protected in
the future. An’ the Saint himself had other
matters on hand, what simpler than that he
should order a deputy to take charge? This
thought he made naïvely known, thereby
causing Brother Francis to smile. The choice
found as great favour with him as with the
child. Very scrupulous, the boy avoided the
smallest claim to the name till it should be
his by right. “Child” he still remained.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was on the Feast of St. Luke, a glorious
day of the Saint’s own summer, that Abbot
Hilary gave it to him. He had no mind to
keep him waiting over long. Conversant
with the main truths of Christianity, their
elaboration could come later.</p>

<p class='c011'>Early in the morning, the day yet barely
awake, Brother Francis roused the child, clad
him in the white robe of the catechumen.
To the east the sky was shot with pearly light.
Birds twittered from the bushes in the garden
below. The soft air came through the
window.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis your true birthday morning,” said
Brother Francis smiling, as he led him from
the room.</p>

<p class='c011'>The child was very quiet. You see him
humble, trustful; his spirit wrapped in implicit
faith. The Unseen World with which he
would presently be in communion already enfolded
him in its vastness. He felt unconsciously
that to which he could assuredly have
given no word. Where formerly his soul in
bondage to another, possessed by another’s
will, had striven to storm unlawful heights,
and thereby in a measure,—through no actual
fault of his own,—had become co-operator
with Satanic cunning, now trustful, with full
and quiet Act of Faith, it awaited the Divine
Gift.</p>

<p class='c011'>A soft grey light was in the chapel, though
night shadows lingered yet in the corners. A
faint breath of incense pervaded the place.
Man and boy bent the knee in honour of Christ
in the Blessed Sacrament, then knelt near the
font.</p>

<p class='c011'>To them came Abbot Hilary. Throughout
the ceremony the child held himself very simply.
When the holy water touched his forehead,
and he heard the words, “<i>In nomine
Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus sancti</i>,” he fetched a
little sigh. Here the assurance of safe harbourage
had come to his soul. From thence he
could look forward nothing doubting.</p>

<p class='c011'>Methinks his child’s heart sang a Te Deum
as presently Brother Francis led him to a pew
near the altar that he might hear the Abbot’s
Mass. Gravely happy he knelt there, seeing
the future in a glow of soft light.</p>

<p class='c011'>With supplication and praise the Mass went
forward. At the Elevation of the Sacred
Host, Michael raised his head a moment.
He could not see the White Disc held high
in the Abbot’s hands. But, with the inner
sight of faith, he saw a Figure standing before
the altar, saw the gleaming Robe, the Grave
Eyes, and the Wound upon the Generous
Hand stretched out to him....</p>

<p class='c011'>Truly, as Brother Hilary had said, it was
his birthday.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch25' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXV<br /> <br />AN ORCHARD EGOIST</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>WHEN Peregrine left Dieuporte he struck
straight through the valley between
the wooded slopes of the hills. The autumn
morning was very fair, as we have seen.
This, added to his recent escape from blackness,
lent zest to his spirit. For the first
time for many a long month he found his
heart going out to Nature. It winged freely
to meet her, as a bird escaped from a cage.
He welcomed the breath of the wind upon his
forehead, he exulted in the sunshine, in the
good clean smell of the earth around him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Extraordinarily light-hearted, he pursued his
way, giving gay greeting to peasants as he
passed them at cottage doors. The intoxication
of the morning caught him; he was
drunk with its beauty and brightness. Around
him lay orchards aglow with red and russet
apples. In one, a girl was standing on a
rough ladder, gathering the fruit into a blue
apron. As she worked she sang:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<i>When Autumn brings her goodly store</i></div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>Of fruit and corn to ev’ry door,</i></div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>We garner all with care.</i></div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>Then bird and beast and man always,</i></div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>Throughout the colder, bleaker days,</i></div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>The harvesting shall share.</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<i>When Autumn purple, gold, and red,</i></div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>Brings to us Winter’s daily bread</i></div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>In glowing croft and field,</i></div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>We bless the rain that watered earth,</i></div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>The sun that brought the crops to birth,</i></div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>A gracious store to yield.</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<i>When Autumn bids the brown leaves fall,</i></div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>When earth half drowsing hears her call</i></div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>To sleep through Winter days,</i></div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>We gather all there is of good,</i></div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>Of earth’s most bounteous wholesome food,</i></div>
      <div class='line in2'><i>Give God the heartfelt praise.</i>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>She sang in a low round contralto, a voice
as ripe as her beauty. Peregrine, plucking
the tabor from beneath his cloak, joined in
with the last verse. She turned her head at
the sound, gave him a gay good-morning at
the end of words and music.</p>

<p class='c011'>“So you are a musician,” quoth she.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Of a sort,” smiled Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“No bad sort,” she returned with a
motherly air which sat well on her. “Sing
you to me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What should I sing?” demanded Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That which likes you,” returned the girl.
“We ever perform best that which pleases us
most.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine laughed, and struck a couple of
chords on the tabor.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I see freedom pleasing me most at the
moment,” he said. And set himself to sing:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<i>Of all good gifts is freedom more</i></div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>To man than other good gifts be,</i></div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>By it he sets most gracious store.</i></div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>To roam at will o’er hill and lea</i></div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>Is truly more to him than gold,</i></div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>Or silver very freely given.</i></div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>Methinks the heart grows never old</i></div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>That ne’er has been in thraldom driven.</i></div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>Who lives in freedom lives at ease,</i></div>
      <div class='line in1'><i>Knows naught of ill or irksome care.</i></div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
 <div class='line c004'><i>There’s little else a man may please</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>In freedom’s stead; no goodly share</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Of oil or wine or golden corn.</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Since freedom is both blythe and gay,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>And like to earth’s most fairest morn,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Of freedom will I sing alway.</i>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>His voice died away. The girl looked down
upon him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A fair song,” she said appraisingly, setting
her teeth in the side of a red apple. And
then she laughed.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why do you laugh?” asked Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>She stretched one arm wide, embracing
Nature, as it were.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Because the day is very good, and because
the apple is sweet, and because—because I
am alive.” She bit again into the apple.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine eyed her approvingly. “Three
most excellent reasons. You find happiness
in life?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Why not?” quoth she between her
munching. “Is it not well to be alive? Does
not the sun shine for me, the wind blow for
me, the earth bear fruit for me, the birds
sing to me? Truly I find happiness in life.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You envy none?” asked Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>She laughed. “Whom should I envy? Old
Mother Esther down yonder, who has three
cows, and is toothless, and has a wart as big
as a hazel-nut on her nose? Grizel Burnside,
who has a husband who beats her six nights
out of the seven, and half a dozen squalling
brats tugging at her skirts? Lambert Groot,
who they say has a bag of gold pieces he
counts the while he yells with rheumatic
pains? For my part, I say let Esther keep
her cows and her wart and her lack of teeth;
Grizel, her husband and her brats; Lambert,
his gold and his rheumatism. I am happier
with our one cow, my own teeth, my freedom,
and my health. I’d barter no jot nor tittle of
my own self for all their belongings in a heap
at my feet. I am I, and glad on it.” An
unconscious egoist, she faced him laughing
from the ladder.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yet,” suggested Peregrine, “there are
others rich, well-fed, and with good health,—plenty
of them in the world. Do you not
envy them?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not I,” laughed the girl. “How know I
that, for all their solid riches, they love the gold
of the buttercups in April? that, for all their
good feeding, they would pluck and eat blackberries
from the hedges along with a juicy
apple? that, for all their health they could,
race the dewy meadows bare-footed, face the
August sun uncovered, or meet a January
snow-storm unshrinking. Sooner be myself
with the likings I know, than they with
tastes more than perchance foreign to
me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“My child,” said Peregrine gaily, “I appreciate
your confidence in yourself. An’ a
man have confidence in himself ’twill lead
him far.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She looked at him from beneath her eyelashes.
“Whither hath it led you?” she asked
demurely.</p>

<p class='c011'>This caused Peregrine a slight inward
wince, brought his light statement closer to
book. In a sudden flash he saw his words not
too wise. Truly may confidence in himself
lead a man far, and yet no nearer his goal.
Her question, drawn at a venture, shot very
near home. Yet he had no mind to betray
this thought to the laughing girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Truly,” he said airily enough, “at the
moment it hath led me to the company of a
very fair egoist.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Head on one side she surveyed him, doubtful,
questioning. “I know not that word,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I see it meaning one exceeding conscious
of their own personality,” remarked Peregrine.
“An’ you be not conscious of yours, I stand
rebuked.”</p>

<p class='c011'>She mused a moment. “An’ you mean
that I know well that I am Méllisande the
Fair, as men call me, that I take pleasure in
my beauty and my health, then you need
no rebuke.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed,” said Peregrine smiling at her
<i>naïveté</i>, “I mean that very precisely.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then,” quoth she, with her ever ready
laugh, “the word suits well enough.” She
dropped to silence a moment; then spoke.
“Whither fare you now?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I fear me,” said Peregrine, “that I fare
on a very elusive quest.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What manner of quest?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“The quest of a woman.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh!” Méllisande opened dark eyes, braced
herself against the ladder. “Tell me more,”
said she interested.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There is little enough to tell,” returned
Peregrine, “and that being so, the quest appears
the more mad.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Briefly he gave her the history of the past
months, eliminating matter he held undesirable
to repeat. She listened, gravely intent.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have heard tell of the woman,” she
said as he came to an end of the story, “veiled,
and with quiet eyes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You have heard tell of her!” cried Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>She nodded. “Listen. ’Tis my little
brother who has spoken of her. Truly I
have thought his words but imagining, since he
is a dreamer and over-apt to fancies, at least
so I have held. But more than once he has
spoken of this woman, and in much the same
words that you have given me. Once I
thought ’twas the Blessed Virgin he had
believed to see, but he assured me to the contrary.
This woman, he avows, is purple-robed,
her face white as jasmine flowers, and
half hidden in a veil; her eyes, when she looks
at you, are like moonlit lakes among mountains,—lakes
unruffled by the least breath of
wind. This is what my brother Aelred has
told me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then,” said Peregrine very firmly, “I
will speak with Aelred.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Méllisande pointed to the right.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You will find him yonder, most like,” she
said. “Follow the road through the village,
bear upwards along a rocky path, and you
will hear the sound of falling water. Make
for the sound. A stream comes out of the
rock near here, emptying itself into a cup-shaped
hollow. ’Tis there where Aelred
plays most often, or dreams rather, for he
is not over-given to play, being somewhat
crippled. Question him gently, and perchance
he will tell you more. But he cares
not to speak too freely of such matters, since
men are apt to mock at him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I thank you well,” said Peregrine, and
turned to go.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Not too fast,” cried Méllisande, “first
you must have reward for your song. Hold
out your cloak.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine, laughing, spread out his cloak
as bidden. She tossed apples to him till he
vowed he could carry no more. Bestowing
them about his person, he gave merry thanks.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Farewell, orchard egoist,” he said, “perchance
we meet again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who knows!” she nodded. “Fare you
well.” She saw him depart light-footed.
Once again she turned singing to her apples.</p>

  <h2 id='ch26' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXVI<br /> <br />AELRED’S BELIEF</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>THE sound of falling water caught on
Peregrine’s ear as he came to the foot
of the small ravine. It was but a faint musical
tinkle, since rain had been scarce during
the past weeks. His way led him up a
narrow pathway, somewhat rough, and steep-rocked
on either side. The rocks were covered
with stonecrop, a mass of white and
yellow flowers earlier in the year; now merely
small succulent leaves remained. Here and
there grew patches of heather, its flowers
likewise gone; only an occasional purple
spray lingered among the withered brownness.
The sun beat warmly on the path, falling very
straight between the rocks.</p>

<p class='c011'>Before him the way turned right and left,
divided by a grass-covered slope. The sound
of the falling water brought him to the left.
Here the rocks held stunted trees, ash and
elder, drawing small sustenance from the
sparse earth. Further on the trees thickened,
vegetation became more luxurious: now the
sound of the water came very clearly to his
ear. A moment later a slight bend in the
path brought him upon it, a thin silver stream
coming from the rocks above, and falling into
a cup-shaped hollow.</p>

<p class='c011'>By the hollow a boy was sitting. Peregrine
judged him ten years old or thereabouts.
His brown hair was cut straight across his forehead,
and at the nape of his neck. He sat
very still, his hands clasped round his knees.
From afar you might have fancied him sleeping,
but for a certain tenseness in his attitude.
Coming nearer, you would have seen his eyes
open, staring straight before him.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sound of Peregrine’s step on the rocky
earth brought him back to matters present.
He raised his head quickly, the movement
like that of a startled fawn.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine, coming near the boy, paused.
“May I rest awhile?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed, sir,” said the boy shyly, “this
is no private place.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yet courtesy prompts the query,” smiled
Peregrine, “since I see you first established
here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>For answer Aelred moved a wooden crutch.
Peregrine sat down by him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A very peaceful place,” said he, scarce
knowing how best to broach the matter he had
in mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I like the sound of the falling water,”
said the boy.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis musical enough,” said Peregrine
somewhat absently.</p>

<p class='c011'>Aelred eyed him frankly. Then with a
child’s directness put a frank question.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Are you very weary?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine turned. “To speak truth, not
weary at all at the moment, though methinks
I have known weariness more often than
not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yet you are strong,” said Aelred wistfully,
glancing from the man to his own
twisted foot.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Weariness of body were better to suffer
than mind weariness,” said Peregrine a trifle
bitterly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Aelred was silent. Here was matter beyond
his ken.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yet you do not see me weary now,”
said Peregrine quickly, noting his sorry look.</p>

<p class='c011'>There fell a silence. He saw not how to lure
the boy to speech, fearful lest question should
shut his lips beyond chance of opening them.
He felt in the child’s mind something alert,
watchful, ready to hide on the smallest hint
of intrusion. He saw not in what fashion
he might best make gentle approach. Thus
it was he sat silent, listening to the falling
water.</p>

<p class='c011'>Had he known, he could have used no better
method of allurement than this very silence.
The boy saw himself in a manner a host. He
had averred, and truly, this was no private
ground, nevertheless it was ground but rarely
visited save by him. This gave him in a
sense possession of it. It had become his by
some inscrutable law of communion with
its spirit. An’ you are alive to the great
elemental forces of Nature, you will find a
waiting spirit in all isolated places, ready to
welcome or repel according to the kindredship
of your soul. Welcomed, you are made lord
of the domain by tacit consent. You return
again and yet again till it becomes more fully
yours by sovereign right. The presence of
an intruder is made known to you rather by
the resentfulness of the spirit of the place
than by any volition of your own.</p>

<p class='c011'>Aelred found the man beside him no intruder:
he knew him for a welcomed guest.
Therefore it behooved him to show hospitality.
To this end, he broke presently into
shy yet courteous speech.</p>

<p class='c011'>“A thrush nested in yon thorn-bush in the
spring. I saw her teach three little ones to
fly.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here came opportunity. They were off in
a moment among bird and beast, capping
each other with greater marvel as to the
ways of the woodland creatures. Aelred
found his master in these matters. Ere long
he became sole listener, drinking in the man’s
words with eager ears. Peregrine told him of
his own boyish rescuing of the hare from the
huntsmen and harriers. Further, of finding,
once on a time, a sorely wounded fox cub, of
the vixen’s moan over it; told of carrying it
back to her lair the while she trotted beside
him, dog-like in her confidence; told of her
jealous guard of it through the days of its
mending; and, at the last how he had returned
to find her and her young playing before the
nest, the once injured cub among them;
told how she had picked it from among the
rest and laid it at his feet in gratitude, yelping
softly with delight the while.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here was comradeship of taste that brought
them to quick understanding. There is none
that draws together so quickly or so surely.
Anon Peregrine ventured on the matter most
present to his mind; spoke briefly of his seeking.
He put no question; making his own desire
known, he waited. Aelred, having seen a
comrade in the man, was quick to give a
comrade’s aid. His face a-quiver he spoke
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, but I have seen her. I know not
who she is nor whence she comes. Most
often she kneels by me in the church down
yonder when I am alone. ’Twas there I
first saw her. Once she met me on the hillside.
I mind the day well. I was angered
since one had spoken ill words to me. Up on
the hill I saw the sun setting, and I—I knew it
should not go down on anger. So presently I
was sorry. Then I saw her coming towards
me. It seemed that she came right from the
sunset, though ’twas not that truly, but
merely that the light was behind her. She
looked at me, and called me, “Little Aelred.”
She touched my forehead, and so left me. I
know not whither she went, as I know not
whence she comes. But I mind that day
very well.”</p>

<p class='c011'>You see him alight, eager, exceeding desirous
of making his knowledge of the woman
known.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then is she no fancy of the brain,” said
Peregrine softly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Indeed no,” laughed the boy joyously.
“Perchance even now she is down yonder.
Truly I have seen her there full oft.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here was very definite assurance. The
whole simplicity of it held him silent. For
months he had wandered heart sick in pursuit.
Now he found himself almost in her
presence, and at the moment when, for all his
vaunted words to Abbot Hilary, he had found
himself nigh on abandoning the quest, turning
for satisfaction to Nature and her varying
moods. He saw himself a coward for his
doubt: knew more certainly his great desire
to come to her presence. I do not think he
dwelt vastly now, no more than formerly, on
what the meeting should bring him. It was
enough to know she was no dream. An’ he
could come to full assurance on this score,
’twere joy enough. The boy brought to
words what trembled in his mind.</p>

<p class='c011'>“An’ we went now to the church, we might
find her there.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine got to his feet; lifted the boy from
the ground, adjusted the crutch beneath his
arm.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come,” he said briefly.</p>

<p class='c011'>They set out adown the rocky path. Peregrine
found it none too easy work to curb his
steps to the boy’s halting pace. His heart
made haste before him, went eager to the
desired meeting. He doubted not for one instant
he should find her there. Long sought,
long desired, he would see her face to face.</p>

<p class='c011'>The village appeared deserted; the inhabitants
within doors were partaking of the
noonday meal. The sun lay golden on the
roadway. Anon, before him, he saw the grey
church, the porch shadowed by a great yew
tree. Aelred’s crutch tapped softly up the
flagged path. Together they entered the
door.</p>

<p class='c011'>The place was cool and dusky, smelling
faintly of incense and candle fumes. A great
Crucifix hung above the Rood Loft, dimly
discernible in the shadows overhead. The
Pyx Light shone soft and red.</p>

<p class='c011'>They looked round: saw the building empty.
Disappointment fell cold to Peregrine’s heart.
Aelred lifted a reassuring face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Anon she may come,” he whispered.
“Shall we wait and pray.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Pray you an’ you will,” said Peregrine
somewhat coldly, “I will bide here.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He stood within the doorway, arms folded.
He had no mind to bend the knee. Ancient
memories were hotly astir within him. Age-old
custom, or something stronger, called
loudly to him: pride mocked at the
call.</p>

<p class='c011'>Aelred limped up the aisle; made for a bench
on his right. Here he came to his knees, while
Peregrine watched motionless. An’ she passed
not him to enter, she must needs come by
a small door by the Lady Chapel. His eyes
for the most part on this, though now and
again turning to the kneeling boy, he waited.
The minutes passed leaden-footed. At length
Aelred got up from his knees.</p>

<p class='c011'>Very sick at heart, Peregrine came through
the porch, and into the sunlight. There he
awaited the boy. Aelred came towards him,
his face radiant.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You saw her!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine stared. “I saw her!” he echoed
dumbfounded.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She came even as I knelt,” he said joyous.
Then stopped, struck mute by the sight
of the man’s face.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Ah, what is it?” he asked on a note almost
piteous.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Bah!” laughed Peregrine mockingly. “I
might have known it but a figment of the
brain. Yet that a child should be deceived!”</p>

<p class='c011'>“What mean you?” asked Aelred trembling.</p>

<p class='c011'>“There was no one near you.” He shot
forth the words bitterly. Then turning strode
away.</p>

<p class='c011'>White-faced the boy looked after him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch27' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXVII<br /> <br />THE RECLUSE</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>AN’ you knew Greatoak Forest,—a vast
place and well named by reason of its
trees,—you might perchance have heard rumour
of its recluse. Men spoke of him as a
tall man, clad in a white woollen garment,
feeding on roots and berries, and in league with
mysterious powers.</p>

<p class='c011'>This was but half truth, as such rumours
are like to be. That he was a tall man may
be safely accorded; that he wore a white
woollen garment fashioned after the manner
of a sleeved cloak, and girt about the waist
with a leathern belt, may be also accorded.
Given these two matters, further rumour was
not over accurate. Forest roots and berries
he would have found poor sustenance for his
muscular body. He gained better nourishment
from the wheat and vegetables he grew
in the ground around his cabin; from snared
rabbits, dressed and seasoned with herbs
and onions. At leaguing with mysterious
powers he would have laughed frankly and
very truly. Nature was the goddess he worshipped,
and he saw in her an all-sufficient
mistress.</p>

<p class='c011'>In body he was tall and muscular, as you
have seen. In face he was dark and sunburned,
having something of a foreign mien. Black
hair covered his head; his eyes, grey and far-seeing,
looked straight upon the world unflinching.
Clear eyes they were, having the look
of seeing more than was physically apparent.
They would gaze at you very frankly after the
manner of a man who has nothing to hide, and
yet you found yourself no nearer knowledge of
the mind of the gazer in meeting them. No
doubt this last lent a hand in giving colour to
the rumour of mystery, though truly that he
was seldom seen beyond the forest was mystery
enough for peasant folk. Your coarser
man dwells willingly in herds, save when he is
injured. Then it is his instinct to creep away
from sight after the manner of some wounded
beast.</p>

<p class='c011'>Oswald was his name: and Oswald the
Recluse men called him. He was seldom seen,
as I have told you. Now and again men
had glimpses of him, this at dawn or sunset,
walking some distant hillside. Boys penetrating
the depths of the forest in search of
birds’ nests brought back word of him sitting
by his cabin door, very still and silent. Yet
none ventured within distance of discovery
by him; or fancied they did not. Had they
guessed at the alert mind within the still body,
they had known their presence less hidden
than they fondly imagined.</p>

<p class='c011'>It disturbed him no more than the scampering
of a squirrel up a tree, or the rustle of a
dormouse among dried leaves. These brown-faced
youngsters, peering shyly curious from
among bush and bracken, were to him but part
and parcel of the great stream of Nature’s
life around him. They were young enough
to have no conscious separation from it.
They took hunger and sleepiness in the natural
course of things, neither denying the one
nor combating the other. He saw in them
merely young animals, unselfconscious though
shy of the unknown: in this case of himself.
It was with your grown man that, for the most
part, he knew himself in lack of sympathy;
those who neither consciously nor unconsciously
accept Nature as their mistress, nor
see their own lordship of her: those who grumble
and carp at her decrees, master neither of
her nor of themselves.</p>

<p class='c011'>In this mastery alone he saw full freedom of
spirit. I have told you that he worshipped
Nature; that she was his mistress. This is
true. But it was the worship a man gives to
the woman who is his mate as well as his
goddess; who knows himself her lord even
while he does her willing homage.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>One night, standing before his cabin door, he
surveyed the stars. The air was still and
frosty: the quiet of the sleeping forest lay
around him. This was the hour he felt his
own most fully; himself awake, alive, while
Nature slept. Even the trees were wrapt to
slumber, very motionless, their bare branches
darkly outlined against the luminous sky.
There was no moon: among the brighter stars
the Milky Way flung her whitely powdered
track, a far-off illimitable path. Immensity
around him, his soul winged dauntless out to it.</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly he came back to earth, very alert,
on the scent of an intruder. You would
have declared all around to be silent, still as
the grave: Oswald stood with head bent,
listening intently. The minutes passed: from
far off came the lightest stirring of the undergrowth,
a mere rustle as of the faintest
breath of wind. Muscles tensioned, Oswald
raised his head, looked towards the place
whence the sound had come. Now it grew
more distinct; there was the snapping of a
twig. Suddenly from among the trees stepped
a tall man, dark-cloaked. The two confronted
each other, hostile for the moment.</p>

<p class='c011'>Oswald broke the silence, since truly it behooved
one of them to break it.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Who are you?” he asked, putting the most
natural question, and the one that came readiest
to his tongue.</p>

<p class='c011'>“One, Peregrine,” replied the intruder.
“Truly an’ you are surprised to see me, which
I take it you be, I am none less surprised to
see you. Are you spirit or mortal?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Very much mortal,” returned Oswald
laughing. “And mortal enough to be frankly
startled by your appearance. I look not for
wayfarers so far afield, and at this hour.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine gazed around him. In the moonlight
he saw the cabin; a rough place enough,
built of logs and wattles.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You live here?” he asked wondering.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I do. An’ you would have rest and shelter
you are welcome to what I can offer you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I accept your offer gladly,” said Peregrine.
“I have walked far enough for the
nonce,—over far for that matter.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then the sooner you come to a halt the
better,” returned Oswald. And he led the
way within the cabin.</p>

<p class='c011'>For all its roughness it was clean and freshsmelling,
holding a scent of peat, bracken,
and dried herbs, which latter dangled in
bunches from a string across one corner. A
peat fire lighted the place dimly, flinging great
shadows on the log walls.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Sit you there,” said Oswald, pointing to a
heap of bracken; and forthwith busied himself
with the preparation of food.</p>

<p class='c011'>Ere long he had it ready,—crushed corn
mixed with goat’s milk and boiled to a smooth
paste, sweetened with honey. He ladled it
steaming from an iron pot into two bowls
fashioned from the dried and seasoned rind
of a pumpkin. Peregrine wolfed it down; you
could see he brought hunger to it as a very
excellent sauce. For drink, Oswald made a
beverage from herbs of his own gathering, a
dark brew but not unpalatable. Anon, filled
and rested, Peregrine gave vent to a great sigh.</p>

<p class='c011'>“That,” he said, “was exceeding welcome.
You saw me pretty near the end of my
tether.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Oswald nodded. “So I fancied. You had
been journeying long?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“It’s five months or thereabouts since I
found myself beneath a roof. You lose track
of time with naught but the look of the fields
to guide you.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“An’ you trust to so scant guidance you
may find yourself sadly astray,” returned
Oswald. “I keep count with these tallies.”
He lifted a bundle of twelve hazel rods from a
corner. One was notched the whole length,
another but half way.</p>

<p class='c011'>“From your marking I judge us to be now
near the middle of February,” said Peregrine
eyeing the bundle.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You judge correctly; the sixteenth day to
be accurate.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“I had thought it earlier.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That is where your mere observation of
the fields makes bad guess-work, since the
weather has a hand in the reckoning,” quoth
Oswald calmly. “Take to my method. A
tally a month will suffice you to carry
around, and a notch in the outer side of the
next one to mark the casting away of the
last.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“No bad idea,” returned Peregrine. And
a silence fell.</p>

<p class='c011'>Oswald watched him. He was quick to read
slight tokens anywhere, whether of character
in a man’s face, or the hint of weather’s change
in sky, wind, or flower. He saw him a man
not wholly content with life, yet not fully
aware of the fact himself. He saw in him
something of an anomaly,—a dreamer without
a dream, a traveller without a goal. This
is unsatisfactory an’ Nature has made of you a
dreamer; Fate, or yourself, thrust you forth
to travel.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Whither were you faring when you
chanced on this place?” he asked presently.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nowhere,” returned Peregrine. “Once
having a goal in view, which I found on nearer
approach to be pure moonshine, I sought no
other. I wander now where fancy leads me.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Oswald shook his head. “Fancy is too
moody a jade for my guide. At times she
leads in hot haste with no consideration for
him who follows. At times she stays moping,
forcing a man to idle in one spot at her will.”</p>

<p class='c011'>At this Peregrine demurred. “I see her
will and mine in accord,” quoth he.</p>

<p class='c011'>Oswald laughed, denying the argument
firmly. “You may think so, but ’tis not the
case. An’ you take her for guide, you have no
will in the matter, or rather, make it subservient
to hers. An’ a man use his own
will, he makes a slave of fancy.” He paused
a moment, then continued. “How know you
your goal mere moonshine? Did you gain it?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Near enough to know it non-existent,
naught but a fancy of the brain.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Oswald moved impatiently. “There you
are back at your fancy. I told you she was no
good guide.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“In this case she was not of my own seeking.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“You speak in riddles,” said Oswald. “You
may think me over-blunt, but, if a man speak
in riddles, methinks he has little to tell. Fact
will bear plain words and close handling.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine looked at him. He was not displeased
with his bluntness. He saw in him
one who came to a grip with matters. Mayhap,
he lost hold on a part of what he gripped
at, since a man’s grasp is not over-large;
nevertheless he saw him making sure of what
he grasped.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You shall have the story plainly,” said
Peregrine. And forthwith gave it to him.</p>

<p class='c011'>On the conclusion Oswald made no answer,
but remained half-musing. When at last he
spoke it was as though he conferred with
himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I too have had glimpse of the woman you
seek. I, too, sought her, moved Heaven and
Earth and Hell to that end, and came no
nearer finding her. Now frankly, I know not
whether she is mortal or spirit. This much I
know truly: she is no fancy as you have said.
Spirit she may be, and probably is, though
I still give the benefit of the doubt to her
mortal nature,—if the doubt be benefit.
Of that I am none too sure. This further
conclusion I have come to also; she is not to be
found for all our seeking. An’ she come again
willingly,—mortal or spirit,—as she came
once in glimpse, ’twill be her affair, not ours.
For my part, I dwell in my memory of her.
That she is existent suffices me. I seek no
further knowledge of her save at her own
will.” He stopped. Then a moment later
he continued. “I see her eyes in the moonlit
pools of the forest; her purple veil in the
spreading of the twilight; her presence in the
quiet of the night. This much my momentary
sight of her has given me, and for the gift I am
thankful.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then you hold the sight no illusion?”
asked Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“None,” said Oswald calmly. “I will put
the matter plainly. An’ a blind man be
restored to sight at sundown, he may get a
glimpse of the sun as it sinks behind the hills.
The morning may dawn cloudy; and throughout
the day, and even succeeding days, he may
get no sight of its further glory. But it was no
illusion that he had seen it, and will see it
again when the clouds disperse. But he can
have no more hand in dispersing the clouds,
than he can have in changing the course of the
sun behind them. There’s the matter as I
take it. You may journey the length and
breadth of the world, and come no nearer her.
You must wait her own coming again.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine thought awhile; found a certain
solace in Oswald’s words. At length he spoke.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Yet the boy saw her. And I, though
present, saw her not.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“That bears out my thought that she is
spirit,” said Oswald, “but does not prove her
fancy. Though doubtless you rubbed illusion
well into the child’s mind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine was silent. Shame struck on
him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Having ever held her purely material you
were like to do so,” said Oswald calmly.
“You were less actually blameworthy than
over precipitate. Since I hold her to be spirit
you were probably beyond the range of sight
of her. I do not say this of a surety since I
hold that sight of her comes at her will rather
than ours; but I do say, that had man or child
given me as great proof of knowledge of her
as yon child gave you, I had followed most
closely in his steps, seen eye to eye with him
as near as might be. On your own showing
you stood far from him.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine was still silent. He felt himself
more than fool.</p>

<p class='c011'>Oswald eyed him kindly. “Do not be
downcast, man. There’s no mother’s son of
us but blunders once—aye, often more than
once, and that, perchance, within a foot of our
goal. Recognizing that, there’s humiliation
to add to the wounds and fatigue of the journey.
This, bringing discouragement, makes
acquiescence in failure the easier course.
’Tis the coward’s outlook. Face the matter
again. In this case I say, take courage; believe
in her, and await her coming.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The words brought comfort to Peregrine.
He looked gratefully at his mentor. You
might have seen trust in his eyes. The
personality and confidence of the man gave
him strength.</p>

<p class='c011'>“An’ you take my advice,” said Oswald,
“you will sleep now. New hope comes with
the morning.”</p>

<p class='c011'>He showed him a bed of bracken, made him
lie down. Then himself laid down at the
other side of the cabin.</p>

<p class='c011'>It was long before Peregrine slept. Thoughts
pursued each other pell-mell through his brain,
one alone predominant and lasting enough to
grasp, namely, that in his host he had found
comprehension of the matter that absorbed
him, and sanity combined. This thought at
length brought him rest. An hour or so before
daybreak he slept.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch28' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXVIII<br /> <br />IN THE FOREST</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>MORNING brought refreshment, and with
it new hope and courage as Oswald had
foretold. At breakfast he put a proposal to
Peregrine frankly enough.</p>

<p class='c011'>“An’ you are so minded, why not bide with
me a time. Men term me a recluse, and so
in a measure I am, finding little congenial in
the majority of mankind. I should find no
constraint in your presence. We could talk
when the mood was on us, and—better test
of congeniality—keep silence when we willed.
Have you mind to try the partnership for a
while?”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine gave willing assent. Already, as
seen, he had found rest in the man’s confidence,
a healthfulness in his quiet sanity. He
saw a haven in the forest cabin, one where he
would abide most gladly. To have no fear of
going a day, or even more, hungry was something
of a novelty to him. The search for food
sharpens a man’s wits with regard to attaining
the necessities of life, but leaves less room
for the development of other faculties. Here
was sufficient for the needs of the body. His
mind at rest on this score, it began to expand
in other directions. His love of Nature returned
to him, as it had returned for a brief
space on his leaving Dieuporte. In this renewal
of his love he realized how long it had
been absent.</p>

<p class='c011'>Tracing his way slowly backwards, he came
to the point where the love had first waned;
saw it in his absorption in the human, namely
Isabel. Up to this point there had been
freedom of spirit; here he first saw his bondage,
realized himself enslaved; slave of the
woman at Belisle; slave of luxury at Castle
Syrtes; slave of Menippus; and, lastly, slave
of an idea. In this last he was, however,
none so certain of the bondage; of the former
slavery he was very sure.</p>

<p class='c011'>Now he felt his spirit free. The intimacy
of Nature again surrounded him; he found
sweetness in her breath; in her still, sunny
days, despite their cold; in her frosty, starlit
nights. He found himself watching the
brown buds slowly swelling on the trees, gazing
with something akin to reverence at the
first pale primrose lifting a shy face among
last year’s withered débris, touching the tiny
fragile flower of the wood sorrel. The clean
healthiness of the forest absorbed him; his
spirit was at one with the tender life awaking
around him.</p>

<p class='c011'>A new idea came to him now. Up to
a point he acquiesced with Oswald in the
thought that the woman would make herself
known to them at her own time; yet he saw
himself fitting his spirit for the meeting. In
this he believed himself in a measure seeking
her. You see him humble; no longer hot afoot
to the chase in his own way, striving to attain
to her by the force of his own will. He never
for an instant lost sight on the thought of her.
Now and again he fancied her eyes watching
him; prayed her then humbly enough to make
her presence known at her own time.</p>

<p class='c011'>Oswald, half laughing, told him he held her
so close in thought no sight of her was needed
to him now. To which Peregrine replied
briefly:</p>

<p class='c011'>“Belief in her may be good; but sight of her
will be better.”</p>

<p class='c011'>In his belief he now surpassed his one-time
mentor. He looked daily,—even momentarily,—to
her appearance, where Oswald was
content to leave it at months or even years
ahead. It was sufficient to him that she existed.
The mere knowledge, without perpetual
watching, was not enough for Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>He saw too great passivity of mind in
Oswald. Though in a measure he recognized
its excellence, his own spirit was a-tingle for
greater action. The man’s quiet certainty
of the woman’s existence was at once an
anodyne and an irritant to him. While
Oswald’s belief quickened his own belief, he
yet saw something lukewarm in his lack of
action. This Oswald guessed at, rather by
intuition than by actual spoken word from
Peregrine. For his part, he saw a certain
weakness in Peregrine’s constant expectancy.
He watched him walking alert in the forest,
his eyes roving from side to side.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have told you,” he said once quietly,
“that effort on your part is useless. She
will come at her own time.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Truly you say so,” returned Peregrine,
“and at the first I had confidence in your
assurance. Now, I know not fully how to
make my meaning clear; but to my thinking
she bids me still seek her; awaits a further
effort on my part.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Oswald smiled. “There imagination has
you in thrall. On your own showing you
have pursued her long without avail. Rest
in her spirit which you know around you, and
await sight of her quietly as I do. Your
constant expectancy of her coming brings disquietude
to your mind.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Reasonable enough argument, and yet one
which Peregrine could not bring himself fully
to accept.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Look at the matter dispassionately,”
said Oswald. “You dreamed the existence
of this woman. Knowing not whether the
dream were truth or reality, you pursued
her for over two years. The pursuit brought
with it disappointment, and worse. Now I tell
you of a certainty your dream was true, and
show you the means by which the truth shall
become fact to you. In seeking her, in your
constant watching for her, you drive her from
you. I know not why this is so; nevertheless
I know it to be true.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine was silent. Here was apparent
certainty presented to him on the one hand;
as the pull against it was his own inner conviction,
which he had yet more than once
proved illusion, so it seemed. For the time
he let the matter be; came again to rest
in the strength of his comradeship, and the
sweetness of Nature round him.</p>

<p class='c011'>So the days passed. March came with
strong clean winds blowing through the forest,
with daffodils tossing golden heads by brook-sides,
a very wealth of gladness. With her
passing came quieter April bringing sunshine
and rain, and the scent of growing things in
the forest. The birds mated and sang; the
whole place was alive and buoyant.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>One night Peregrine awakened suddenly.
At the first waking he fancied Oswald to have
called to him, but his quiet regular breathing
showed him sleeping. Peregrine raised himself
on his elbow and looked around.</p>

<p class='c011'>The faintest grey light fell through the
square opening which served as window. He
sank back prepared for further sleep, when on
a sudden he found himself more fully awake.
He sat up, and again looked round the hut.
The bunches of herbs dangling from their
string looked ghostly in the grey light. Oswald,
lying on a bed of bracken, slept soundly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine got up from his couch, donned his
clothes, barely conscious that he did so. His
mind was busily astir; though as yet his
thoughts had found no conscious articulation.
Being clad, he took a chunk of bread from a
shelf. This much he knew his host would
have freely given him. Then he moved softly
to the door, opened it.</p>

<p class='c011'>The forest lay in the quiet which reigns
most supremely betwixt night and dawn.
For some moments he stood looking towards
the great trees, then stepped without, closed
the door softly behind him.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>Now, an’ you were to ask me for reasons as
to why Peregrine left the hut at this very moment,
I must e’en tell you frankly that where
fifty instincts urged him to the move there was
no one definite reason. This may seem folly;
but verily, to my thinking, there are moments
in a man’s life when he does better to obey
the lightest instinct than the closest reasoning.
We are come now to a time in our Jester’s
wanderings when I see myself penning that
which actually befell him, rather than the
thoughts which led him to action. It may
be that you will guess at those thoughts,
having had some such of your own. An’ you
cannot trace them in his actions, I see not any
words of mine setting them clearly before you.</p>

<p class='c011'>Having put some half-dozen miles or so
between himself and the hut, he began to feel
sleepy. Coming to a mossy stretch beneath
a great oak, he lay down. Three minutes saw
him wrapped in slumber, and he slept soundly.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he awakened it was high noon. The
sun fell through the oak branches, clear upon
the place where he lay. For a time longer
he rested, revelling in the warmth of its beams.
Anon he sat up; ate a portion of the bread he
had brought with him. All around him was
intensely still. Before him were massed bluebells,
a soft luminous carpet. Brilliant nearer
him, they lost themselves anon in the hazy
distances among the trees. He sat a while
gazing at them.</p>

<p class='c011'>He wandered through the forest that day; at
night made it his resting-place.</p>

<div class='pbb'>
 <hr class='pb c004' />
</div>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch29' class='c006'>CHAPTER XXIX<br /> <br />EASTER EVE AND EASTER MORNING</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c010'>EARLY the next morning Peregrine was
again afoot. Coming at length from
among the trees, he found himself on a hillside.
Below him was a hamlet, a small cluster
of some dozen or so cottages nestling at
the foot of the hill. Later, an’ he would, he
might seek food at one of them; at the moment
he had bread sufficient to stay hunger, and
had little mind to find himself again in the
company of men.</p>

<p class='c011'>Partly descending the hill, he sat down
beneath a thorn-bush, looking on the landscape
spread below him. Sounds of life came
to him on the quiet air; here was the clarion
note of a cock, the bark of a dog, the lowing
of cows, and the tinkle of a bell at the neck of
some goat.</p>

<p class='c011'>The time passed pleasantly enough beneath
the thorn-bush. He found himself in no mood
to desert his post. Dreamily he watched
the shifting lights and shadows in the valley,
and on the hills beyond.</p>

<p class='c011'>The sound of footsteps brought him again
to the present. He looked up. Almost opposite
to him were a boy and girl, the boy
ten years old or thereabouts, the girl some
three years younger. Her brown hair was
covered with a purple hood; a dress of the
same colour fell to her ankles; a white kerchief
was folded about her neck; her arms were full
of bluebells. The boy, a sturdy fellow, clad
in green tunic and hose, and having a brown
cap on his head, held a great sheaf of cherry
blossom. Peregrine straightway thought of
Pippo.</p>

<p class='c011'>Coming to a halt they gazed at him, round-eyed,
astonished at the sight of a stranger.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good-day,” quoth Peregrine smiling at
their astonishment.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good-day,” echoed the boy. The girl remained
mute; a very shy maiden.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are well laden,” said Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>The boy glanced at his burden. “We take
them to the church yonder.” He nodded
leftwards up the hill.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine half turned; saw what had before
escaped his notice, a small grey church on
the hillside, set on the edge of the forest.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You carry a fair tribute thither,” quoth
he.</p>

<p class='c011'>“’Tis Easter Eve,” said the boy bluntly.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Oh!” breathed Peregrine. The syllable
showing him ignorant of the fact, the children
eyed him puzzled. How should the passing
of the Solemn Week have escaped him unobserved?
This is what their glances asked,
though they found no words.</p>

<p class='c011'>“She takes bluebells,” said the boy, nodding
towards the girl. “She says Christ must
surely love them, since they are the colour of
His Mother’s robe. I climbed for my cherry
blossom.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Here Peregrine saw Pippo again. His mouth
curved to smile, though memory brought
a lurking sadness to his eyes.</p>

<p class='c011'>Finding no further speech come handy, the
boy turned to the girl.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Come,” he said. “Father Felix bade us
be betimes.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Together they wended their way up the
hillside. Peregrine looked after them, and
towards the church.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>The sun had fallen behind the forest, leaving
it purple-blue against a rosy sky toning
upwards to lilac and grey. The air was alive
and fragrant with the breath of spring. A
thrush sang in an elm tree set close against the
church.</p>

<p class='c011'>Father Felix was sitting on a bench in front
of a cottage door. This was the priest’s
house, and was hard by the church. Since
you have met Father Felix before, though
in other guise, I refrain from present description
of him. His eyes, looking towards
the reflection from the sunset, reflected something
of its calm. You see him musing on
matters well loved by him.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anon bringing his eyes from the sky, a
thought nearer earth, he became aware of a
tall man standing near him. Looking at him,
he saw in him a stranger.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I give you good-evening, sir,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Good-evening,” responded Peregrine.</p>

<p class='c011'>“You are, I fancy, a stranger in these
parts,” said Father Felix.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I am,” returned Peregrine briefly.</p>

<p class='c011'>Here conversation seemed like to come to a
halt. A frank response with nothing added to
it brings matters to a greater standstill than
a shifty answer will bring them. The last
case leaves room for probing; the first makes
further query appear sheer curiosity.</p>

<p class='c011'>Father Felix surveyed him with kindly blue
eyes; Peregrine returned the glance with eyes
no less blue.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Have you come from far?” asked Father
Felix, blinking towards the sunset reflection
in the eastern sky. Yet, for all his blinking,
methinks he saw a good deal.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Recently from the forest,” said Peregrine.
“I have been dwelling there some weeks
past.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The old man smiled. “Then you are a bit
of a hermit like myself. Will you not be
seated?” He moved slightly on the bench; at
the same time indicated a tree stump near
him, thereby giving a choice of seats. Peregrine
chose the tree stump.</p>

<p class='c011'>“And before the forest?” asked Father
Felix. “That is if you will see interest rather
than curiosity in my queries?”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Before the forest I was a wanderer,” returned
Peregrine. Then he pushed back the
hood of his cloak, threw it somewhat from
his shoulders. “You see in me an outcaste
fool.” There was a faint ring of challenge
in the words.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Hmm,” mused Father Felix gently, his
eyes twinkling. “A fool by whose standard?
An outcaste from what company? Methinks
there lies the test as to whether the title
with which you have branded yourself may
not be a badge of glory rather than of
shame.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine looked straight before him. “A
fool by the standard of men, and by mine own.
An outcaste from the Court where I played
the fool.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Since you judge yourself a fool by your
own standard, you are assuredly in the way
of becoming something greater,” said Father
Felix quietly. “For the standard of men, I
pay not over much heed to that measure when
applied to their fellow-mortals. As to the
matter of outcaste,” he looked at him very
straightly, “an’ you be not outcaste from God,
I see in the business less of a boggle than you
perchance see.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“An’ I were an outcaste from Him?”
queried Peregrine very low.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then, my son, the quicker you set about
returning to Him the better,” quoth Father
Felix briskly.</p>

<p class='c011'>A silence fell on these words. If Peregrine
had answer to make it was at the moment no
verbal one. The old man having said his
say let the matter bide. The light in the sky
faded, cooled to a pale blue-grey very restful to
contemplate. A star came out over the forest.
Big and luminous it hung in the clear space.</p>

<p class='c011'>Anon Peregrine roused himself.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I bid you good-evening,” he said.</p>

<p class='c011'>The old man looked at him, seemed about
to speak, checked the words on his lips, gave
“Good-evening” in response. Peregrine went
down the hill.</p>

<p class='c011'>Coming again to the thorn-bush, he halted
irresolute, made half turn to retrace his steps.
He denied the impulse; sat down once more
beneath the thorn-bush.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>Night crept slowly onward, spreading her
dusky mantle over the valley. At the foot
of the hills it was intensely dark, yet with a
soft darkness as of velvet. The night itself
was softly velvet; grey velvet above the hills,
star-sprinkled. Sirius faced him in a dip
between them, blinking now fire-red, now
green. No moon being visible, the stars shone
with a greater radiance.</p>

<p class='c011'>Around and about him was intense silence.
The earth was caught to slumber. Himself
wakeful, he sat immovable, motionless as the
thorn-bush by which he rested. His spirit
winged into the vast spaces, ranged in circles,
returning ever to one point. Staying a moment
there, it went forth again, sent by his
own will, since he was reluctant to allow it
permission to this resting-place.</p>

<p class='c011'>At length his spirit grew weary of the flight.
“I have sought,” she said to him, “and here
is my sole haven. Let me rest now.” Here,
clearly, were the words she spoke. How send
her forth again upon a barren errand? How
bid her seek fruitlessly afar that which lay so
near to hand? His will withdrew from the
guarded sanctuary. Wings folded, his spirit
came to harbourage.</p>

<p class='c011'>The night wore on. A pale light in the
east heralded the coming dawn. He rose
from beneath the thorn-bush, turned up the
hill.</p>

<p class='c011'>Within the church was nearly utter darkness;
only the one red light glowed as it glows
wherever Christ reigns hidden in the Sacred
Host.</p>

<p class='c011'>Father Felix rose from near the altar, came
down the aisle to meet him. His eyes were
heavy with foregone sleep, yet bright with an
immense happiness.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I was waiting for you,” he said.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c011'>An hour later Peregrine knelt before the
flower-decked altar. Through the open door
of the church the dawn showed purple beyond
the hills. The sun, coming up above them,
shot golden beams into the place, falling upon
the Crucifix set among bluebells and snow-white
cherry blossom.</p>

<p class='c011'>Peregrine raised his head. Kneeling near
him he saw the Woman he had sought, looked
straight into her deep eyes.... For all his
joy in her presence it was submerged in the
knowledge of One Who had brought him to
sight of her.</p>

<p class='c011'>Father Felix, turning from the door of the
sacristy, looked momentarily at the kneeling
man. Beyond him, he saw the sun risen
above the blue hills.</p>

    <div>of Banishment</div>

<p class='c011'>A tale of the northern woods that breathes
the true atmosphere of the lumber camp,
draws a vivid picture of the subjugation of the
great forests and the thrilling “drive” of the
unruly rivers. The story traces the fortunes
of one who through a happy chance discovers
the treachery of the man to whom he has entrusted
the fulfillment of his life’s ambition,
and just in time to avert disaster. Yet redress
he must forego, for the man who has attempted
to wrong him is the husband of the woman
he loves. Out of this antagonism of interests
the author has developed a love story that is
full of capital dramatic situations, that opens
up many unexpected developments, and that
proceeds to an impressive and satisfying
climax.</p>

<p class='c011'>The glow of romance kindles in the
new volume by this successful author.
The tale entitled <i>The Swindler</i> and its
sequel, jointly constituting a substantial
portion of the book, strike a full, vibrant,
soul-filling note which is not diminished
in the shorter but no less dramatic stories
which follow. <i>The Swindler</i> is the story
of one who, irredeemably bad in the eyes
of the undiscerning, has all the latent
nobility of his nature called into play
through the faith which is reposed in him
by the one woman who counts.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
